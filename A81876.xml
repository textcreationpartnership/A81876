            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The various end and aime of Courtiers. The way by which they may ingratiate themſelves with the Prince, whatſoever diſpoſition he be of. To this, end it is needfull, that a man be notified to the Prince. Some are known by the ſplendour of their Family, others by their own Induſtry.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T behoveth every man, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires rightly, and in order, to inſtitute his actions; firſt, to conſider the end, or aime of ſuch his enterpriſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They who are drawn to Court, prefix not to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the like end; for ſome are led thither by hope of gain, others by ambition, and hope of honour.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some are drawn thither by a deſire of commanding others; ſome alſo (as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith) by a deſire of deſtroying, hurting, and procuring
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115933:6"/>buſineſſe to others. Few propoſe and intend the advantage and ſafety of the Prince.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The way of obtaining this (whatever their ends be) is common to all Courriers (to wit) the favour of the Prince. In the proſecution here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, every one ſets his wits on worke, and is very induſtrions.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To get the Princes favour, its needfull that you be both known to him, and alſo approve your Manners and Actions, and by ſome laudable way pleaſe him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There are ſome the Splendor of whoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and Authority by reaſon of their office (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more ample or mean; whether purchaſed by Money or diſcended by Inheritance) hath forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their admittance to the Prince. Theſe are exempted from labouring addreſſes; and are, as it were, in the mid-way to further promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They to whom theſe things are wanting in the beginning are put to more labour. But when once they come to be known to the Prince ſo that he judge them fit for his ſervice, are often moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above others, becauſe they being raiſed from a lower place (at leaſt from a matter fortune) become more ſubject, and more attained to the will of the Prince; whom they more ſubmiſſively reverence and eſteem, as the ſole Author of their Dignity and Promotion.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The meanes and way of Nobles (ſo born) is very different and hath much diſparity. The Dignity of their Office or Family puts a kind of neceſſity on them to maintain their own honour, and ſometimes to preferr their own opinion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115933:6"/>the Prince's; who is alſo oft-times more difficult to promote them, out of a kind of Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or feare, leſt their Authority ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult againſt the Author thereof, which to repreſſe would be hazardous to himſelf and his dominion. On the contrary, the ſuppreſſion of one raiſed from baſeneſſe is more proclive; ſo that if the Prince turn his back on him, or ſuffer him to be at the will of great Ones (who for the moſt part have an evill eye on ſuch) he ſoon failes. I ſpeak of Princes diſcreet and prudent, and who know how to limit and circumſcribe the power of thoſe whom they love and advance, not conferring on One the whole ſtreſſe of Command, but even holding under the very Peers; yet this courſe hath not been expedient to ſome Princes.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THere are two wayes eſpecially and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and frequent whereby Courtiers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to themſelves Authority and Favour with the Prince.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One is the courſe of ſuch who go about to procure to themſelves and hunt after publique Charges, Offices, and Dignities; and, in the interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls of ſuch Dignities and Imployments more neer, content themſelves with ſuch as are lower &amp; at greater diſtance from Supremacy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other, is of ſuch as follow the Court
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115933:7"/>continually ſeeking to be imployed in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's moſt ſecret buſineſſes and extraordinary ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations for others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The laſt of theſe is the moſt compendious, and beares the impreſſe and footſteps of ſuch as have been in the moſt flagrant and flouriſhing favour and acceptance with their Prince. Such was <hi>Mecoenas</hi> with <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and <hi>Saluſtius</hi> with him alſo and <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Succeſſor. Of whom <hi>Tacitus</hi> in his Annal 3. ſayes thus: Although <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtius</hi> emulating <hi>Mecoenas</hi> by a prompt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy entrance to honour, yet without the dignity of a Senator, out-ſtript many in power, who had triumphed and were of Conſular dignity; being divers from the inſtitutes of the Auncients by his trimnes and ſpruceneſſe, and by wealth and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance more prone to luxury; had never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe ſuch vigor of mind as was fit for great negotiations, and ſo much the ſharper by how much he did oſtentate and brag of ſleep and ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.</p>
               <p>The like to whom was <hi>Mella,</hi> of whom the ſame <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the twelfth of his Annals, ſaith: <hi>Mella</hi> being deſcendred from the ſame Linage with <hi>Gallio</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> abſtained from the deſire of honour through a prepeſterous ambition, that being a Roman Knight he might equalize the power of a Conſul, and alſo believed that it was a ſhorter way to get riches by procurations and ſoliciting for others, then by negotiating for the Prince.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Divers wayes to be notified to the Prince,</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO be made known and be approved to the Prince the wayes are divers alſo, according to the diverſity both of the Suitors at Court, and of the Times. There are ſome which render themſelves known by ſome action (notably ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſefull or glorious) or elſe by their (more then vulgar) vertue and honeſty. To ſome, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans recommendation hath opened the way to the Prince, and this way is more uſuall then the reſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Princes act in place ſo eminent above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and they are hedged about with ſuch a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous troop of Noble and deſerving Courtiers that a Novice or new commer can ſcarce preſſe through ſuch a thicket of obſtacles unleſſe there be ſome which may lead him by the hand and even force his entrance through them, or elſe that he himſelf can (by ſome unuſual action) draw the eyes of all men and conſequently of the Prince towards him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Memorable is the fact of a certain Architect whom ſome call <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115933:8"/>with oyl, his head invironed with a Crown of Popler; a Lyons skin caſt over his right ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and holding in his right hand a wharle-Bat or clubb. And forthwith in this Attire he approaches the preſence of <hi>Alexander</hi> ſitting on the Tribunal: the novelty hereof drew the eyes of all, and of <hi>Alexander</hi> alſo, ſo that he commanded him to be brought unto him. And although the King he approved not the Project, yet he ordered he ſhould be inrolled, and took him as one of his Family at Court.</p>

                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The manners, conditions, inclinations, and propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of Princes, and their Familiars, are to be known by ſuch as are Court-ſuitors.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. AN unadvanced Courtier, and he who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires both to be known to, and beloved of his Prince, ought to conſider both the manners and conditions of the Prince, and thoſe his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars in whom he moſt confideth; of great Ones alſo, and of all thoſe, who either are able to aſſiſt him, or, on the contrary, (being ſnatcht from the Prince, either by the emulation, fear, envy, hatred, or endeavour, of himſelf or thoſe about him) are able to prejudice him. Firſt, it is neceſſary, that he have a clear inſight into the inclinations and cuſtoms of the Prince, which do commonly follow the temperature of his body; for although this may be concealed by cautelous and wary Princes, yet it can hardly be but that at laſt it will break forth, and ſhew it ſelf; ſince all their actions are ſo expoſed to the eyes of all men, that it cannot be, but ſome will take notice which way they tend. They are alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo ſharply ſtimulated and enraged, by the weightineſſe of negotiations, that forgetting to diſſemble, they betray their ingenies and naturall diſpoſitions: Even <hi>Tiberius,</hi> although the moſt crafty Artificer of diſſimulation, could not ſo well bear up the ſcene of his contracted brow,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115933:9"/>but that time, by little and little, brought all his Arts to light.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſince the propenſions and inclinations of all men, but chiefly of Princes, are divers, and almoſt infinite, yet may they be brought to two heads; one whereof containeth ſuch, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect their Greatneſſe; the other, their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Greatneſſe conſiſteth either in fame or wealth, or in the obſequiouſneſſe of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or, laſtly, in the ſtrength, puiſſance, and faithfulneſſe of Armies. In theſe, as the Prince fareth well, and need requireth, a man ought to accommodate his endeavours; which whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doth wittily, (provided he be neither ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted nor hated upon any other account) ſhall doubtleſſe be moſtly accepted with his Prince.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſame is to be conceived and judged, concerning the vitious pleaſures and affections of Princes: If he be of a diffident and timorous Genius, you may conceive, that a bold Accuſer &amp; Delator, and one who careth not much for the envy of great ones, and is prompt and ready to execute his Prince's commands, ſhall find ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with him; ſuch a one <hi>Tacitus</hi> deſcribeth <hi>Sejanus</hi> to be, He had a body, (ſaith he in the fourth of his <hi>Annalls</hi>) able for labour, a bold mind, ſhie and wary of himſelf, to others a diſ coverer of crimes, cloſely flattering and proud, openly compoſed and modeſt, inwardly gripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and covetous.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If the Prince delight in drinking, he will delight in thoſe thereunto addicted; for which cauſe, <hi>Tiberius</hi> loved <hi>Pomponius,</hi> and <hi>Lucius Piſo;</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:115933:9"/>whereof <hi>Suetonius</hi> writing of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> in his <hi>chap.</hi> 24. ſaith thus, Afterwards the Prince, (to the corrupting of publick manners) ſpent two whole nights and daies, in continuall eating and drinking, with <hi>Pomponius, Flaccus,</hi> and <hi>Piſo;</hi> on the one of which, he conferred the Province of <hi>Syria;</hi> on the other, the Preſidentſhip of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Rome;</hi> and in books profeſſed them, <hi>omnium horarum amicos,</hi> his jolly friends and company at all hours.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſame <hi>Tiberius,</hi> (as <hi>Suetonius</hi> reports) preferred a moſt ignorant and ſimple fellow, that fought onely for a Queſtorſhip, and Tax-gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, before his Nobles, for drinking at a Banquet, himſelf taking off his whole glaſſes.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Society in luſt endeared <hi>Tigellinus</hi> to <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> as <hi>Tacitus, Annal</hi> 14. hath it: <hi>Tigellinus,</hi> ſaith he, became more ſtrong in the Princes mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſociated with him in his moſt intimate and cloſe pleaſures, So <hi>Petronius</hi> the Arbitrator, and Judge of Elegancy, (they are the ſame Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans words, <hi>Annal.</hi> 16.) being taken in among thoſe few familiars to <hi>Nero,</hi> he thought nothing pleaſant and delicate, in his affluence and plenty, but what <hi>Petronius</hi> had given his approbation of. After the ſame example, <hi>Commodus</hi> and <hi>Heliogaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> preferred to all the dignities of the Empire, men moſt like themſelves in licentiouſneſſe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Mutianus</hi> was not ſo well beloved of <hi>Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi> for his faithfull duty and actions, as for that he was moſt fit (before others) to ſatisfie his avaritious deſires.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Such covetouſneſſe endeared a certain youth to <hi>Iſaacius Angelus,</hi> (who held the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115933:10"/>after the death of <hi>Theodorus</hi>) whom he made Preſident of his Exchequer, (although he could hardly write) upon hopes to participate of the large Bribes, which he there might have opportunity to take, from ſuch as had occaſion to make uſe of him in that employment.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Manuel Comnenus,</hi> an Emperour alſo, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for a ſharp Exactor, and crafty Artificer, in gathering of Tribute and Cuſtomes, and one that might largely ſupply his prodigality with mony, choſe <hi>John Rucius,</hi> a fellow rude, and moroſe, and teſty, hard to be accoſted and ſpoken to, of intolerable aſperity and ſharpneſſe; and, in a word, <hi>Procuratorem vultu qui praeferat ipſo,</hi> who carried a Procurer or Solicitor in his very face. And not content herewith, or as if that were not enough, put him in ſuch high Authority, that he not onely trampled upon all others in dignity, but would abrogate and diſannul the Decrees and Edicts of the Prince, and Ordinances of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, upon pretext of his houſhold affairs, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and poleing the moſt neceſſary advantages, (ſuch as was the cuſtody of the Gallies) the chief ſtrength and benefit of the Empire.</p>

                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whether or no, and how the affections of Princes are to be ſeconded and obeyed. How, and wherefore honeſt men, may undertake Courtſhip, and publick Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. NOw that they who deſire to find accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance with a Prince, ought to ſerve him in his affections, is a thing not onely very well known, but alſo experienced, by the daily uſe of Courtiers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An honeſt man will admire this, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that by this rule, he is intercluded and ſhut out, from any entrance into Court, whereby he is bidden to follow the inclinations of the Prince, ſince they are oft-times devious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant, from the path of reaſon and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I confeſſe, for him that would live a life al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together innocent, and remote from the cuſtom of thoſe, who are addicted to evill Arts, and their own Genius, I eſteem it better, that he abſtain from Court, becauſe ſometimes men are there corrupted, though formerly moſt innocent and faultleſſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Of ſuch corruptions, let us ſee an example or two. <hi>Feſtinus,</hi> the familiar of <hi>Maximinus,</hi> in the time of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour, had go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd <hi>Aſia</hi> with much renown, and fame of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and modeſty, being a ſharp reprehender of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115933:11"/>the violences and cruell facts of <hi>Maximinus,</hi> and of the calumnies; by which he (for his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage) had circumvented many.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But obſerving, that by ſuch doings, his Companion was made Preſident of the Pretorian Bands, (which Dignity was ſecond to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorſhip onely) he changed his courſe of life, and imitating <hi>Maximinus,</hi> did many things cruelly and unjuſtly.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>John Pucius,</hi> (mentioned a little before) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred in the affairs and treaſure of <hi>Manuel</hi> the Emperour, with great integrity, whereby it came to paſſe, that the haughtineſſe and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man actings of the Emperour, became more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable to mens minds: At length, applying his mind (as <hi>Nicetas</hi> teſtifieth) to the getting of wealth, fell ſhort of none of the like Office, in covetouſneſſe; and became alſo a preſident to his friends to do the like, many of whom being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by his example, followed his ſteps: Others, although better, and ſuch as could not be corrupted themſelves, yet ſuffered others to be tainted, for fear of imminent baniſhment, to ſuch as ſhould dare to oppoſe themſelves.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> juſt in name and deed, Preſident to the Athenians, of their publick Exchequer, at firſt, of his own ingenuity, and alſo to diſcharge the office of an honeſt man, was carefull to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe, who were employed under him, from purloyning and robbing the Treaſury. At length they accuſe him of pilfering, and exclaim on him, as one of the moſt rapacious and ravenous thieves, that ever had been; and hardly could he eſcape condemnation. At length being quit, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115933:11"/>his Office being prorogued and ſuſpended, he was adviſed to imitate others, who were his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors; and to wink at the thefts and leger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demains of his Colleagues. So by and by he got the name and report or a good man, by the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and judgment of all.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Such courſes are ſtill taken in the Courts of moſt Princes, either from the malice of ſuch, as are in chief authority, (and look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on honeſt men with diſdain) or elſe by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence and ſtupidity, of the Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Therefore to retain honeſty in Court, is very difficult. Yet, if any one, by the exigency and neceſſity of his own fortune, or by the ſplendour and greatneſſe of his birth and lineage, or dignity of Office, or by an impulſive deſire to ſerve his Country and friends, or being called thither by the Prince, ſhall undergo this kind of life, he may perſiſt therein, in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, although a good man; at leaſt, may live there a while; and as opportunity ſerves, and occaſion offers it ſelf, not onely be ſerviceable to himſelf, but others alſo.</p>
               <p n="10">10. I ſpeak of the Courts of moſt harſh and cruell Princes; for to live in the Court of a wiſe Prince, and one who loves honeſt men, is far leſs difficult.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Honeſt men heretofore, undertook pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick functions and employments, not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of deſire to advance the publick, but ſometimes alſo, that they might anticipate and prevent the entrance of evill men into ſuch em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. For the ſame cauſes may they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115933:12"/>alſo, and ought to ſeek acceſſe to Tyrants, and Princes given to volupty; that ſo, if not with open face, yet obliquely, and as much as in them lies, they may either impede and hinder pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous counſells, by delaying things evilly conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, objecting ſome difficulties to them; or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in ſome more mild and plauſible.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Burrhus</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> (conſidering thoſe times) were accounted not onely good men, but good Courtiers, who being governours of <hi>Nero</hi> in his youthfull time, obſerved the ingenie and diſpoſition of the Prince to be leight and ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and proclive to luſt; leſt he ſhould break forth, to the debanching of any of the moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious women, granted him to love and court a free woman, whereby in time he reſtrained his fury, having taken for a cloak of ſuch doings, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca Anuaus Serenus;</hi> who pretending love to her, openly beſtowed thoſe largeſſes, (the words are <hi>Tacitus</hi> his own, in the 13th. book of his Annalls) which the Prince ſecretly conferred on her. Thus a good man, not knowing how to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der luxury, licentiouſneſſe, and perverſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells, may at leaſt divert them, and bend them to ſuch a courſe, as from whence leſſe hazard may enſue, both to the publick, and the Princes ſame and renown.</p>

                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The rarity and condition of honeſt men in the Courts of Tyrants and diſſolute Princes. The ſeminary of evill men, and the Art of approving themſelves to the Prince.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>PEthaps ſome will ſay, It ſeldome chanceth that a Tyrant or diſſolute Prince takes to him an honeſt man. Nor can I deny that it is very rare, but this alſo I affirme, that there are few Princes houſes in which ſome good man (at leaſt) may not be found drawn thither if not by a call from the Prince, yet by a deſire of accommodating the good, and infringing the power of evill ones, and may keep his Station there by the aide and benevolence of the better ſort, or the friendſhip of ſome great or noble One: obſerving firſt and keeping that wholeſome temperament of <hi>Lepidus</hi> whom <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the fourth of his <hi>Annals</hi> propounds as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a good and wiſe Courtier, who neither by abrupt contumacy hath irritated and provoked the Prince, nor by a deformed obſequiouſneſſe conſented to all his luſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſame <hi>Tacitus</hi> commendeth <hi>Labeo</hi> and <hi>Capito;</hi> of whom ſpeaking. That age, ſaith he, bare two Ornaments of peace at once: but <hi>Labeo</hi> being more famous for his incorrupt freedome and liberty; <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pito</hi> for his readineſs to ſerve thoſe in Authority, were much approved, <hi>Annals</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It cannot be denied, but that a Courtiers life
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115933:13"/>to an honeſt man is more beſet with difficulties then to another man. But this labour wilbe made good by the greatneſſe of the glory and pleaſure of mind which he ſhall have. Moreover, if he act wiſely, and accommodate himſelf to ſuch things as hee ſees cannot be changed, I dare be bold to ſay that he ſhalbe at length endeared even to the worſt of Princes, more deere certainly then others in after times who ſeldome with due faithfulneſſe tranſact the buſineſs of their Prince, at leaſt not ſo exactly, but that every man may lawfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe himſelfe better ſervice from a good man.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To this purpoſe was the Counſell of <hi>Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtius</hi> and <hi>Mecoenas</hi> whereby the one to <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> the other to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> commended the love and friendſhip of good men becauſe their owne regard of eſtimation, and religious Conſcience, is more prevalent with them to deterr them from diſhoneſt things, then fear of puniſhment can do others; or their owne imbecillity, or want of ſtrength, can reſtraine.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But, as is ſaid, the growth and ſproutings up of evill men is more plentifull in Courts, who chiefly do approve themſelves to the Prince by two cauſes; firſt by Adulation and doing any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit the Prince commandeth, and ſo much the more ſervile is he by how much the hope of profit allureth: moreover there is this, wherein Princes much pleaſe themſelves, that they may have ſome in compariſon of whom they (although evill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) may ſeeme to be good. Others alſo ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their life more ſecure amongſt ſuch as are like themſelves.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Tyrant being required to expell
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115933:13"/>from Court a certaine fellow, who by his obſceni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties had incurred the odium of all men, anſwered that he muſt retaine him in the Court, leſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſhould ſeem to be the worſt there.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They who know themſelves obnoxious to ſome vices have this way with them, that they cloake themſelves with a ſhew of honeſty, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring themſelves with thoſe who are worſe. And it is the old Artifice of ſuch as Rule, to chooſe an unlike and unequall ſucceſſor, that ſo their own doings may appear better &amp; more illuſtrious. Nor was <hi>Auguſtus</hi> other wiſe minded while he called <hi>Tiberius</hi> to his aſſiſtance ſeeing his Arrogancy and Cruelty, nor <hi>Tiberius</hi> when he delivered the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to <hi>Caligula:</hi> of which, <hi>Tacitus</hi> is the Author.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But firſt it is very neceſſary that an honeſt man be ſober and ſparing in ſpeech: for Princes do ſeldome give freedome to ſuch, nor was it ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſefull to <hi>Plato</hi> the liberty which he uſurped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Dionyſius Syracuſa:</hi> for therefore was he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to a certaine Marriner, and ſold into the Iſle of <hi>Creta,</hi> from whence being redeemed by certaine Philoſophers, he was admoniſhed either to abſtaine from the Courts of Princes, or to ſpeak pleaſing things unto them.</p>
               <p n="9">9. With like counſell <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> inſtructed <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſthenes</hi> his kinſman, whom he was fitting and preparing to accompany <hi>Alexander</hi> that he ſhould ſpeake but ſeldome and pleaſant things to him, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe word his life depended.</p>

               <argument>
                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How, when, and with whom, a man may uſe Flattery. The condition of true, and free Adulation. The neceſſity of Aſſentation and flattering.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. IT cannot otherwiſe be but Flattery muſt be uſed with ſuch diſpoſitioned Princes as have been ſpoken of, that ſo a man may oblige them. But this is not to be done after any manner of way; for, a too ſordid and ſervile Adulation and flattery diſpleaſed even <hi>Tiberius;</hi> who was heard when he went out of the Court to ſpeake in Greek to this effect (O men fitted for ſervitude). They are the words of <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the 3 of his <hi>Annals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Flattery uſurped and too often uſed becomes as hurtfull as when omitted and neglected. For it many times happens that he whom we manifeſtly flatter, ſuſpects us of deceit and craftineſs towards himſelfe. It is the judgment of <hi>Aeſchines</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that flattery ought to have ſomething of truth, and of the ſpecies and ſhaddow of liberty and freedome; that ſo we may perſwade not onely the Prince, but others, that we ſpeake cordially, and thereby conſerve our Credit and Eſteeme with them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Croeſus</hi> in the time of his reigne had through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned the Ingenies, and inclinations of kings, and what would pleaſe, or diſpleaſe them: for when on a time <hi>Cambyſes</hi> king of the Perſians had enquired of thoſe that ſtood about him, what
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115933:14"/>they judged of him in Compariſon of his father <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and all had conſented that he was greater then <hi>Cyrus,</hi> becauſe he had added <hi>Egypt,</hi> with the Command of the Sea to his paternall kingdome: but when <hi>Croeſus</hi> his turne came to ſpeake, he adjudged him inferiour farre to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> becauſe as then he had begotten none like to himſelfe. This anſwer ſeemed to ſavour ſomewhat of freedome, and was therefore the more ſatisfactory to <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſes</hi> his vanity then the reſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Notable was the flattery of <hi>Valerius Meſſala</hi> reported by <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the firſt of his <hi>Annals, Meſſala Valerius,</hi> ſaith he, added this that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Oath was yeerly to be renewed in <hi>Tiberius</hi> his name. And being asked of <hi>Tiberius</hi> whether or no he had uttered this Sentence of his own head anſwered that he ſpoke it ſpontaneouſly and that in thoſe things which concerned the publique, he could uſe no other Counſell then his owne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hazzard of offence, and ſo there remained nought but the ſpecies or ſhew of flattery.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Like to this is that which the ſame <hi>Tacitus</hi> reports of <hi>Ateius Capito</hi> in the third of his <hi>Annals.</hi> That <hi>Lucius Ennius</hi> a Roman Knight being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Treaſon in that he had coyned into money a Promiſcuous Effigies of the Prince, <hi>Caeſar</hi> quaſhes and countermands the accuſation, <hi>Ateius Capito</hi> openly ſlights the buſineſs out of a kind of freedome (for neither ought the power of judging and determining be taken away from States-men and Counſellors neither ought ſuch an evill Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to paſſe unpuniſhed) was not much troubled thereat, leſt he ſhould thereby permit an in jury to be done to the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:115933:15"/>6. It were eaſie to bring other examples of this kind; but thoſe that have been produced, may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to inſtruct ſuch, on whom a neceſſity of Adulation and Flattery is impoſed. And leſt ſuch mens flattery ſhould be conjoyned with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique or private diſcommodity, it's ſufficient that it be ſometimes ſatisfie the vanity of the Prince.</p>

                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How, and after what ſort, the Counſels of Princes are to be handled and ordered by a Courtier.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>LEt a Courtier likewiſe beware that he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle not with the Counſels of his Prince although called thereto, and ſo cannot honeſtly, avoid it. For ſuch Princes do for the moſt part aske Counſell with the ſame mind that <hi>Xerres</hi> did, when he went about the Warre of <hi>Greece.</hi> He convocated the Princes of <hi>Aſia</hi> as if he would deliberate with them about the buſineſſe of the Warre. I have call'd you (ſaith he) my Nobles to Counſell, leſt I ſhould ſeem to act after my own liſt without your advice; But yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that your obedience to us in theſe things is rather required from you, than a carefull and doubtfull deliberation. <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> the Predeceſſor of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> deſiring to marry his Siſter, inquired of his Counſellors whether any Law of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> did forbid ſuch a Marriage. They obſerving that the King inquired, not ſo much about this
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115933:15"/>out of a deſire to have the queſtion abſolved and his doubt cleered, but that he might have a plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er diſcovery of their minds, anſwered that no Law indeed allowed what the King required, but that there was a kind of law which avouched that Kings might do what them liked. So that a man may judge, whether credit or obedience be to be given to him when he asketh our advice, even from the inclination and diſpoſition of the Prince, and the nature of the buſineſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You have already had Examples of Kings I will give you another of a man who although he bore not the name and title of a King, yet ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the office of one formerly in Spain. Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando being dead, the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Maximilian</hi> exhort <hi>Charles</hi> De <hi>Auſtria,</hi> (then Agent in <hi>Flanders</hi>) to take upon him the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of King of <hi>Spain,</hi> although his Mother <hi>Joan</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Ferdinando</hi> was alive, and by reaſon of ſickneſſe unfit for government. The Nobles are convened in <hi>Parliament,</hi> before whom Cardinal <hi>Ximenes</hi> eloquently ſetteth forth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to excuſe the Novelty of the buſineſſe. The Nobles being more obſervant of an ancient Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome and of the Queen, then was meet obſtinately vote againſt the King who ſoon after was to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. <hi>Ximenes</hi> leaping from his ſeat, and being moved, ſhews that the buſineſſe in agitation, was not to be doubted on, nor needed their counſels or advice, and that Kings in their entrance to a Kingdom are not to expect the Conſent of Subjects. That they which were convened were not callèd thither by neceſſity, but that they might have occaſion by the promptitude, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115933:16"/>of their ſuffrages, to ingratiate themſelves with the Prince; and that they might ſeem to act out of duty, what was to be done out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Not expecting therefore their approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he affirmed that <hi>Charls</hi> would proclaime himſelf King at <hi>Madrid,</hi> whoſe example other Citties afterwards followed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such reaſon of their Actions do Princes uſe, not only in like, but in moſt Caſes. Scarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing is adviſed for other end then this only, that their deſignes may receive approbation by the many ſuffrages, and votes they have for them; or elſe to take an inſpection of the mind and bent of ſuch as they adviſe with. Such was the fetch of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> witneſſeth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A Courtier therefore muſt carefully ſearch out the mind of the Prince, leſt he accidentally perſwade to any thing that may prove offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Princes will, being dubious, let him ſeigne ſomewhat to ſhake off the buſineſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and (having brought arguments on both ſides) let him leave the free election and choice to the Prince; if he conceive not throughly the buſineſſe, hearing the reaſons on the contrary, if he be wiſe, let him alter his opinion.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Nor ſhall that ſhame and bluſhing (for truly it is a ſhamefull although familiar evill with great ones, that they bluſh to be inferior to ſuch whoſe advice they follow) diſorder the Prince, when you remit the liberty of conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own prudence. And you ſhall alſo avoid the Perill which is imminent to Counſellors
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115933:16"/>when the things they adviſe the Prince to, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their expectation.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If following his firſt deſignes the Prince ſhall not obtain ſucceſſe, he will at leaſt acknowledge the Courtiers prudence, who foreſaw a future evill while it was yet evitable and to be eſchew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If you be urged to give your opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a thing altogether unlawfull, you ought to find out ſome pretext of delay, or to intreat that a third man be called, for the more diligent examining thereof; whereby the thing being more maturely waighed, it may appeare whether any thing in it concerne the Princes dignity or ſafety.</p>
               <p n="9">9. By the former way <hi>Burrhus</hi> inhibited <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes</hi> firſt attempt to kill his mother, himſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing toexecute her if ſhe were found guilty of the offence, and that that ſhould make her defence no not her parents. In the interim while the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections are preparing to be publiſhed, <hi>Neroes</hi> rage is abated, fears are aſſwages, and the cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and thought of the fact, although not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together abandoned and caſt out of his mind, yet was deferred till another time.</p>
               <p>But this way doth not often nor in all buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe take place, but chiefly in ambiguous and doubtfull matters; yet before one under take ſuch a buſineſſe, a man ought to look into the ingeny and diſpoſition of the Prince and whether he can bear ſuch protractions and delayings or not; for there are ſome ſo impatient of loyterings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes, that whoever uſeth them, ſhall certainly incurre their diſpleaſure.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſuddain Motions of Princes, which are either to be pruned and taken away, or to be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>HE that hath to do with ſuch kind of Princes, ought to be skilful and expeditious in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting ſubitanious and haſte-requiring Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sith that (as it oftentimes happens) we may be put to it, not to adviſe, but to find out a way to execute deſignes, if theſe ſeem to oppoſe both Reaſon and honeſty, wayes are to be propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as remote and at as much diſtance as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp; ſuch as may be wound about with the ſhew of Facility, or Equity, or Security: moreover it muſt be offered to conſideration, that ſuddain undertakings are diſcriminous, and full of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Unleſſe the Prince be haſty and impatient, I doubt not but he will follow that which he ſhall judge to be moſt facile and ſafe. But if (through impatience) he will not hear ſuch coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels as tend to protraction, or ſtay; nevertheleſſe, ſuch a kind of anxiety of prudence, or affection towards the Prince may excuſe him that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades; who had rather things were done ſlowly with ſecurity then prematurely and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly with deſtruction to their Maſter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But if in ſuch precipitate Courſe as the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115933:17"/>Prince ſhall chooſe, ſome difficulties ſhall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, much more then will he perceive the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and diſcretion of him, that perſwaded the contrary courſe. If he ſhall give ear to thoſe, who propound ſlower waies; ſuch interſtice or pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing time, will adminiſter many things, which may reſtrain the will and cupidity of the Prince; and himſelf may obſerve, that what he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, could not have been done, or, at leaſt, not without abſurdity.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But oftentimes, that which the Prince propounds to himſelf, is brought to that paſſe, that even in its firſt riſe, it may be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very difficult; but in its progreſſe, plainly unatchievable, and not to be accompliſhed. You may not at all animate the Prince, to undertake ſuch things; rather with venerable ſilence ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that he obſerve his own mind, leſt while you diſſwade, and difficulties ariſe, he ſeek an eaſier way to fulfill his deſire, which otherwiſe (ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his force amongſt thoſe obſtacles) would of its own accord vaniſh, and be aſſwaged.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Sometimes it ſo falls out, that the Prince demands the execution of ſome wicked things, from a good man; in which caſe, I ſuppoſe, no man can be ſo well fortified with reſtraining reaſon, but that he may be ſometimes tainted with ſuch defilements, eſpecially if opportunity, and the reaſon of the thing, take away all place for excuſe, or ſubſtituting another to the office and adminiſtration. This courſe therefore was made uſe of by <hi>Burrhus,</hi> when <hi>Nero</hi> conſulted the killing of his mother, where no other effect followed his diſſembled ſilence, and the ſtrait
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115933:18"/>wherein he was, then; that a woman (though otherwiſe alwaies weak and impotent) ſhould, after an injury, be more ſharpened and imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For <hi>Burrhus</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> being ſent for, ſtuck for ſome time both doubtfull and fearfull: <hi>Tacitus,</hi> in the 14th. of his Annals, ſaith, They were both a long time ſilent, leſt being provoked, and put to it, they ſhould diſſwade him. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Seneca</hi> (till this time more prompt and ready) looks upon <hi>Burrhus,</hi> as if the queſtion ſhould be put, whether or no the murther ſhould be committed, and put in execution by the Souldiery. <hi>Burrhus</hi> anſwers, That the <hi>Preto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> were obliged to the Houſe of the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and (being mindfull of <hi>Germanicus</hi>) durſt not act any bloody thing againſt his progeny. Let <hi>Anicetus</hi> fulfill his engagement. Thus <hi>Burrhus</hi> freed both himſelf and his Souldiers, from exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting a very great villany.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I confeſſe, thou canſt not merit at the hands of ſuch a one, whom thou employeſt and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangleſt in ſuch commiſſions. But as the caſe ſtands, I think it more conducible, and of greater avail, that ſuch as are like <hi>Anicetus,</hi> ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther execute ſuch things, then thou.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Moſt ſafe it is, to foreſee in ones mind and thought, the deſires of a Prince; and before they break out, or take too deep root, to grub them up, or prune them.</p>
               <p n="10">10. There are very many, who have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the great force and ſtrength, of kind and flattering entreaties, and (as <hi>Paryſatio</hi> called them) thoſe ſilken words, which ſome uſe about
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115933:18"/>ſuch buſineſſes as theſe. But ſuch as deſire to uſe this kind of remedy, need be in great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with the Prince, and to have audience from him, as one ſpeaking (which is very rare) not more from affection, then from reaſon. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, in ſome one or other, this courſe may ſucceed, but not in all things nor caſes.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Their way ſeems beſt to me, who by their genius, being facetious, and apt for witty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, and upon that account, in favour with the Prince; may repreſent to him the danger and turpitude, of ſuch counſells, as the Prince is feared to encline to, by ſome oppoſite and pithy Narrative or Comedy, and ſuch as may ſeem to aime at ſomething elſe.</p>
               <p n="12">12. To this, as we have ſhewed, a great dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity and readineſſe of wit, and pleaſantneſſe of ſpeech, is very requiſite: And alſo he muſt take heed, leſt the Prince ſmell out and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that himſelf is the argument of ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall diſcourſes, or comicall repreſentations and ſhews: As <hi>Tiberius,</hi> of his fratricide, and killing of his brother, in a Tragedy, compoſed by <hi>Scaurus,</hi> which he named <hi>Atreus;</hi> and <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> of his divorce, in that of <hi>Helvidius,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Ceno,</hi> believed themſelves to be upbraided. To this it is alſo neceſſary, that this narration be fitly and trimly interwoven with other things, leſſe ſquaring and agreeing with the Prince; and that which principally furthers the buſineſſe, is, that it ought not to be incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and repeated ſeriouſly; and yet, leſt it ſhould ſlip by his ear, it may be iterated by a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115933:19"/>caſuall repetition. The pleaſant conceitedneſſe of the Narrative, makes a deeper impreſſion of thoſe things which are ſpoken, and becauſe they appear ſpoken, as not ſtudied-for, but <hi>ex tempore,</hi> and according to a preſent occaſion and ſubject, they will not offend the diſdainfull ears of the Prince.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Other waies there are of this Moderation, whereby you neither foment and bring aid to the Prince's luſts, nor in vain wreſtle with them, are fetcht from Occaſion, and the very nick and junctures of times; and from Accidents, ſuch as even the approach and ſuddain comming in of one of the Prince's Pages or Lacquies, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to you.</p>
               <p n="14">14. If the caſe wholly require, that you muſt oppugne ſome one of the Prince's affections, then ought you to aſſail and ſet upon another affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, equally valid and prevalent in him, and ſo cauſe a kind of reluctancy and wraſtling in the Prince's mind. And firſt demonſtrate, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhew, that whatever we ſpeak, proceeds from that veneration and duty, which we owe unto him. By this means, <hi>Mutianus</hi> held <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> to his buſineſſe, and kept him from acting that to <hi>Cerialio,</hi> which (prompted by what hope, I know not) he endeavoured to have effected.</p>

               <argument>
                  <head>The Argnment.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Princes have a four-fold Temperature, from their originall in in Nature: How a man may converſe with each of them. The Art of Courtiers, in aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating others to them.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THat theſe things may more proſperouſly be proſecuted and effected, it greatly condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to know the Princes temperature, which they for the moſt part have in common with others, this onely excepted, That whereas in other matters they are more powerfull, ſo are they more impotent and weak, in moderating their affections and inclinations; and theſe, for the moſt part, are more violent in them, then in others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He in whom yellow Melancholy, (which in Greek is called Choller) is prevalent, will be prompt and ready for action, proud, ſubject to anger, a lover of humble and obſequious duties and ſervices, heavily offended with ſuch as are refractory, impatient in executing, precipitate and haſty in Counſells, a contemner of other mens judgments, if they diſcord with his own; cruell to ſuch as injure him, but placable to ſuch as are hurt, if they remember not again the injuries; hating ſuch as are mindfull of an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; a ſpeedy and preventing revenger of ſuch, whom he fears or doubts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He who ſhall be a manuall ſervant to ſuch
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115933:20"/>a one, had need to have his eyes and Eares open, that he may readily underſtand and execute at the beck of his Command not objecting, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting, leaſt by his contradictions he move the opinion and Imagination of the Prince to Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy, and ſeeme to him to think him ſelfe more wiſe then hee. Let him not be ſhie to ſubmit to the meaneſt office, even to that which may ſeem below his owne fortune, let him bear injuries and not long remember them, and after an affront or rubb, be the more officious. Let him not ſhew or tell to any what admonitions and adviſements he gives him, leaſt he ſeem to upbraid him; hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and covering over one office with another as one ſayes, leſt the raine beat thorough. When the Prince is angry, let him not come neere him, for then all things will offend him, and even ſuch as are moſt deere to him, neither by word nor deed, can then curry favour with him: Familiarity with ſuch a <hi>Genius</hi> is eaſily turned into Contempt, (which therefore is to be avoyded) although the Prince himſelfe incline towards it. Let all things therefore be compoſed rather to Reverence and Modeſty: for ſuch are Lyons, ſometimes kind, but in the end cruell and fierce to ſuch, who are moſt known to them, even to their keepers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Such as are of a ſanguine complexion are moſtly of a merry <hi>Genius,</hi> lovers of pleaſures and witty conceits, avoyding the ſad intricacyes, and conteſts in buſineſs, deſirous of peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, committing the adminiſtration of affairs to others, and bearing nothing more temperately then complaints, Courteous and full of humanity, pleaſant and amiable abſtaining from in juries eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115933:20"/>great ones, not more mindfull of things received then of things done, very deſireous to pleaſe and accommodate others, and for the moſt part frank and bountifull.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They who are employed under ſuch, may not in any wiſe neglect the duty of veneration, and muſt handle ſerious matters very ſparingly. They who tranſact the weighty and difficult buſineſs of the Common-weale, ought not to approach his preſence before they be called in, or be aſſured that he be not at his vacant diſports and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; otherwiſe they interrupt his chiefe delights, and cauſe him to bluſh by their ſudden approach, and being taken at unawares feare a ſecret and racite check or taunt from them. While <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> was ſporting, and in his <hi>paſta Tiempo</hi> one comes and tells him that <hi>Antipater</hi> was at the dore, whereupon he being diſturbed, and not knowing how to obſcure himſelfe hid the dice in the bed, bluſhing to be ſeene by <hi>Antipater,</hi> when he was at his paſtimes. Wherefore, as they who have the principall care of the Empire by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces command, are ſupereminent to others in ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous buſineſses; even ſo are they themſelves out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtript by others in their free and familiar acceſſe to the Prince, who avoydes and ſhunnes the more ſerious and grave, as diſcording with his owne <hi>Genius</hi> and naturall diſpoſition.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They who have <hi>Jove</hi> for their propitious ſtarr, and are capable both of ſerious matters, and of gameing and paſtimes, are for the moſt part very acceptable to ſuch Princes; ſo that they be cautious, that while they are abſent from the Prince, their too much facility and courtlineſſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115933:21"/>diminiſh not their Authority with others. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this obſervation (as the vulgar Proverb hath it) <hi>Familiaritas contemptum pariet</hi> Familiarity will breed contempt, Contempt will give Audacity and boldneſſe to make complaints, as if you did them a kind of wrong and injury, which the Prince going about to take away as being an Enemy to mournfull and ſad things, will endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him whom he ſhall find moſt manifeſtly culpable.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Prince who is of Melancholy complexion and diſpoſition is ſlow in Counſells, penſive muſeing, diffident, ſuſpicious, witty, and for the moſt part malizing, diſpoſed to ſilence, uttering ambiguityes, and rather ſerving and traceing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens ſenſes and opinions, then diſcovering his owne; a diſſembler, an enemy to merry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits and familiarity, loving ſolitude, difficult of acceſſe, a friend to few and but a cold one, eaſily hateing, by reaſon of diffidence and diſtruſt (which never leaves him) avaricious, and abſurdly timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, equally hating offences and offenders; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placably deſirous of Revenge, and whom (though reconciled) you had need to feare.</p>
               <p n="8">8. With theſe kinds of diſpoſitions a man muſt deale circumſpectly and warily, &amp; firſt he ought to be moderate in his ſpeech, and as it were to adviſe upon every word, left he ſpeak any thing imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent or offenſive, and ſpeak not unleſs compell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In veneration and reverence let him be more then ordinary, abſtaining from contradictions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murring in counſells unleſs urged to ſpeak, leſt his black Melancholly being incenſed turne into Choller, and that into hatred; chiefly, where you
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115933:21"/>think the repulſe will be facile and eaſie. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting be not unreaſonable, for to be ſent away empty from a Prince is oftimes dangerous, and a Melancholick and ſad perſon is alwayes exceſſive and ſuperfluous, and will deny that he thought he had offended him whom he ſo diſmiſſed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him an enemy; this feare will hardly be bought out by any Artifice whatſoever. Such will remember injuries a long time, and do mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure other men by their owne Genius and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</p>
               <p n="9">9. In briefe, This conſtitution is the ſharpeſt of all, difficult, and moſt uneven and diſordred by reaſon of the variety of things which the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation repreſenteth and offereth to it. By which their life is made the more laborious who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to ſuch mens ſervice.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Phlegmatick participateth of the weight and flowneſſe of the Melancholick; but, as it is unlike in nature and inclination, ſo is it in malignity and diffidence. He hath his heart as it were environed with Cold, and from hence it is that he diſtruſts rather himſelfe, then others, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to undertake great matters becauſe he deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paires of the ſucceſſe, or is ignorant of the way and meanes how to carry them on. He is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in conſults, fearefull in executing, of a ſtupid Genius, not ſharp and harſh in hating, not vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and eager in loving.</p>
               <p n="11">11. For ſuch, an active Miniſter, and one prompt, and ready in mind and hand, is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the Prince when he ſhall find one fit to execute and accompliſh what he accounted deſperate, perceiving the imbecillity of his owne
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115933:22"/>Genius: and he will love and admire ſuch a one, and imbrace him as a neceſſary Creature, and ſuch favour which is bound with an opinion of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, is for the moſt part durable, which ſuch a man obſerving may ſo act, that he may effect thoſe things which the Prince looks upon as hard and impoſſible, and bring them to a proſperous iſſue, and this ſhall he do (if poſſibly) himſelf; at leaſt, let him not have an aſſociate more prompt then himſelf, and alſo beware he be not long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from Court, leſt the chief of buſineſſes be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Prince. For if any be found fitter for ſuch imployment; you ſhall be leſſe valued, or at leaſt, leſſe needfull; and ſo being once or twice paſſed over, and not imployed in ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, be at laſt neglected and not accounted of.</p>
               <p n="12">12. It is the old art of Courtiers not to chooſe aſſociates, but ſuch as they themſelves doe very much excell in vertue and prudence, that the darkneſſe of others may be a foil to their ſplendor, and the Prince may not eaſily find one whom he may oppoſe and ſet againſt them, or prefer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. Adde that theſe leſſer ones, as oft as there is need, will eaſily be open to and ready to ſerve thoſe to whom they either did, or may owe their fortune, although by baſe and corrupt wayes and arts. This cannot juſtly be expected from an equall, or from him who ſtrives in his own ſtrength.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Theſe are the kinds of humane Inclinations to which Princes are no leſſe obnoxious then Peaſants; being propenſe and readily bent, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to to this, ſometimes to that courſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115933:22"/>to the prepollency and force and prevalency of this, or the other Temper and conſtitution.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Age, Buſineſſe, and Cuſtome, do alter and change the Temper, Diſpoſition, and Actions of Princes; and that Inclination which by reaſon of fear lay hid (this fear ceaſing) they betray many wiſe men and Philoſophers, noted and obſerved for the ſame things.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt although theſe things are often thus, yet are they not for perpetuity and alwayes ſo to be accounted. Age, Buſineſſe, and Cuſtome do vary and change the temper of the body, why not then the Inclinations and Actions of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?</p>
               <p n="2">2. In time of Warre, Princes will imbrace mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary and fighting men, whoſe favour (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. by degrees when things are pacified) will eaſily wear out and wax old. If the Prince incline to pleaſutes or any other affection, he will alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to love ſuch as are miniſters and furtherers to him therein.</p>
               <p n="3">3. See what <hi>Tacitus</hi> teſtifies of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> The times wherein he was had divers changes of cuſtomes and manners; he was notable in his life and reputation when a private man, or in com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mand under <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> cloſe and crafty, in counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting vertue, whileſt <hi>Germanious</hi> and <hi>Douſus</hi> were alive; mixt of good and bad, while his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115933:23"/>was healthfull; of inteſtable and incredible cruelty, but covertly luſtfull whilſt he loved or feared <hi>Sejanus.</hi> At laſt he broke forth into lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and diſhonorable actions, after that he (having ſet aſide ſhame and fear) followed his own Inclination. Acute and tart was the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which <hi>Paſſienus</hi> paſſed upon <hi>Caligula:</hi> That there was never a better Servant, nor ever a worſe Maſter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. 'Tis incredible to be ſpoken with what va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manners, <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla</hi> acted: And <hi>Plutarch</hi> makes a doubt whether Fortune chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Inclinations, or only unvailed and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered thoſe miſchievous diſpoſitions which had long laid hid in them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To ſpeak rightly, The diſpoſition and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny of ſuch is not altered, but that which lay hid through feare (that being removed) breaks forth: as <hi>Leontius</hi> ſaid of <hi>Zeno</hi> he was like a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent which being frozen with cold cannot hurt, but being thawed and refreſhed by the heat of the fire draws forth his ſting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tripho,</hi> as <hi>Joſephus</hi> witneſſeth, while a private perſon and only a Collector of the Popular bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volencies and Subſidies, perſonated a good man; but being made a King, preſently ſlipt off his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard and diſguiſe, and openly ſhewed, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of goodneſs had appeared in him, 'twas on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly colourable and counterfeited.</p>

                     <hi>How far Traitors may prevail with a Prince by flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries; and how a Prince is to be warned and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed againſt ſuch.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. BUt oftentimes vain fellowes do inſinuate and creep into Princes, by occult and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eret ſuggeſts and flatteries, who do very much alter the Prince's genius and diſpoſition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To ſuch kind of men, <hi>Tacitus</hi> imputeth the haughtineſſe and crudelity of <hi>Vitellius.</hi>

But in brief, it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that moſt of them who have made uſe of ſuch mens ſervices, have degenerated. Such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors curry favour with the Prince, while they oſtentate and boaſt before him his greatneſſe, power, and utility; who doth ſo much the more willingly embrace them, by how much the leſſe he knowes and underſtands the parts of his own office and charge, not perceiving, that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud him, that ſo they may betray him, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to odium and contempt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And truly, the moſt ſecure way of betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Prince, is the being obſequious and ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him in his avarice, cruelty, and luſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115933:25"/>that he cannot condemn the Traitor, but he makes himſelf guilty.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>Francs,</hi> a people in <hi>Germany,</hi> with the help of <hi>Egidius,</hi> then commanding by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man power, had driven <hi>Clodio Comatus</hi> out of his Kingdom; one of his friends deſiring to have him reſtored, aſſociates himſelf with <hi>Egidius;</hi> and having had ſufficient knowledge before, how to do it, inflames and ſtirs up his avarice and cruelty.

               <p n="6">6. <hi>Sejaenus,</hi> when the Roman Empire was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, and ready to fall to him, ſee how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny arts he uſeth: He ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving conſidered what a waiting Courtier is to do, in reſpect of the Prince, let us come now to what he is to do, in reſpect of, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe, who are his domeſtick ſervants, whoſe Office is continually, to be employed about the Prince's perſon, and therefore very uſefull for ſuch, as ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>k addreſſes to him, either by procuring them an extraordinary acceſſe, or by mentioning them to him, or informing them of occaſions and opportunities, to diſpatch their buſineſſe. Princes for the moſt part, carry one kind of countenance in private, and another in publick; and do more freely diſcloſe their minds to thoſe their domeſticks, whom they believe to be faithfull and truſty, ſuppoſing that their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and low condition, is not capable of any endeavour, either traiterous or miſchievous.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Who knowes not, that <hi>Claudius</hi> was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the commands of ſuch, who had been bondmen? One whereof (<hi>Pallas</hi> by name) he had ſo enriched, that himſelf on a time, complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to one of his wants, had this reply, That if he made ſure to be adopted by <hi>Pallas,</hi> he ſhould forthwith be rich. The ſame was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, that <hi>Claudius</hi> married <hi>Agrippina,</hi> after that, by the help of <hi>Narciſſus</hi> (formerly alſo a bondman)
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115933:26"/>he had ſlain his wife <hi>Meſſalina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Who knowes not alſo, that while the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſtood, the power thereof, was ſometimes upheld by Eunuchs; and but for them, <hi>Arbetius</hi> the chief Commiſſioner of the Empire, had loſt his life, when <hi>Veriſſimus</hi> accuſed him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Borilus</hi> and <hi>Germanus,</hi> two kitchen-ſlaves, by the authority whereby they held <hi>Botoniates,</hi> one of the Emperours, altogether ſubject and obnoxious, rendred him ſtrange and abſurd to <hi>Iſaacius,</hi> and <hi>Alexius Comnenus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Put caſe, the Prince doth not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his counſells to them, yet are they more eaſily ſifted out and accuſed by ſuch. Nor can it be, that a Prince can alwaies keep on his vizard in private: Affections kept cloſe and ſuppreſſed, break forth amongſt the multitude, and become conſpicuous to men, when privacy before hath given them liberty.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is a thing altogether neceſſary in Court, for a Prince to eſteem men of all kinds, even the vileſt, uſefull to him; and to believe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, that prudence and ingenuity encreaſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with authority and fortune; which <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianus,</hi> writing to <hi>Epictetus,</hi> ſhewes, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> and his two ſlaves, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, although one was Groom of the Stool to the Emperour, the other a wiper of ſhoes; yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> who had lately ſold them as unuſefull creatures, not onely inſinuated into their favours, but alſo commended their pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and diſcretion.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Fortune ſcarce ever advanced any man to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115933:27"/>that height in Court, but that ſhe procured him as many foes, as friends; and never brought any man ſo low, but that ſhe could afterwards either hurt him further, or again in ſome kind or other do him good.

               </p>
               <p n="8">8. It will be then the part of a wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man, to procure the friendſhip of the Prince's Familiars, whatſoever they be, by any ſuch officious ſerviceableneſſe, as reaſon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation will permit.</p>

                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There are four kinds of great ones at Court. How the firſt ſort ought to be honoured, obſerved, and entreated. How cautiouſly a man ought to confide in Princes, who are not very conſtant.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>FRom the Prince's familiars, let us come to ſuch as are great at Court, who are of divers kinds: Some are eminent, by the ſplendour and excellency of their birth and parentage, yet are not in intimate favour with the Prince; others very gratious with him, and yet not mounted to honours; others prevalent with him, both by honour and favour; others both flouriſh in his favour, and are employed in negotiations.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:115933:27"/>2. The benevolence and good will of the firſt ſort of theſe, will little conduce to thy grouth in preferment, who nevertheleſſe are to be cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and reverenced, both for their own merits, and alſo becauſe, that though they may not hurt you themſelves, yet may they by their retainers and friends.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For men of illuſtrious and noble Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, are highly eſteemed, and prevail much with ſuch, and with others, by being obliged by an old kindneſſe or good turn with others, by the reverence and eſteem of their greatneſſe and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, (which eaſily changes the Princes mind) do therefore favour them, and Retainers to their ſervice.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Archilaus,</hi> King of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> had omitted to ſalute and court <hi>Tiberius,</hi> when he was Agent at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> to his great prejudice and miſchief; for <hi>Tiberius</hi> (having got the Empire) out of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of revenge, pretending ſomething more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, commands him to be called to <hi>Rome,</hi> where the wretched man dyed an untimely death: Yet the Hiſtorian teſtifieth, that he omitted not that duty through pride, but being admoniſhed by ſome intimate friends of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> becauſe that while <hi>Cajus Caefar</hi> flouriſhed, being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Orientall affairs, friendſhips and correſpondencies with <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſeemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We are here to conſider, that great ones of this ſort of fortune, as they are oft-times im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent and weak in meriting, yet have ſtrength enough to hurt you: Theſe therefore, although they ſeem burdenous, and ſuſpected to the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115933:28"/>Prince, are to be reverenced nevertheleſſe; and we muſt make ſome pretext to reſtrain their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, leſt they become our enemies.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If it happen, that the Prince will put thee into the hands of ſuch, (which is uſuall with Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers) as you may not refuſe this kind of conteſt or combat, ſo ought it to be managed with great Art, and choice of Occaſion and opportunity, that all men may ſee that thou acteſt not only by reaſon, but alſo giveſt ſatisfaction to the Prince. Such an enterpriſe is full of hazzard, but (if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, as having the Prince for its author) is the way to augmentation and encreaſe of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
               <p n="7">7. One here acts all things, in his own name, although he have many helpers, eſpecially ſuch as are under the degree of Nobility; for fear, leſt if they ſhould not do ſo, they might offend the Prince.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Another adheres more cloſely to the Prince, by the encreaſe of his fame and renown, if he be prudent, chooſing ſpecious occaſions, of doing laudable ſervice to his Prince, and to the emolument and advantage of the Publick.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But a man muſt be very cautious, leſt he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing, that thou canſt not bring to paſs; for, beſides that the vulgar judge all things by the event, and believes, that Right and Juſtice ſtands in the ſame ſtation with Fortune, you will wonderfully weaken your fame and favour, wherewith the Prince embraced you, by ſiniſter ſucceſſe; For he, to aboliſh the ignominy, and becauſe he fears, leſt he ſhould be debaſed in the eyes of his Subjects, and animate his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115933:28"/>whom he in vain oppoſed, will be conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to diſguiſe and hide this authority, and the eſteem he had of you.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Yet take heed that you believ not, that while I ſpeak of conteſting with Nobles &amp; great ones, I would have you act any thing, or deal with them by force, ſince that cannot be done without tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult and noiſe; nor that you ſet upon him with contumelies, and calumniations, for that's the part of men of mean fortunes, and baſe corrupt judgments, and their end is ſeldom honourable or auſpicious. See how it fared with <hi>Piſo,</hi> whom <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> had ſent into <hi>Syria,</hi> to reſtrain the hopes of <hi>Germanicus,</hi> who carried himſelf ſo inſolently, that the Prince, having advanced <hi>Germanicus,</hi> was neceſſitated to leave <hi>Piſo</hi> to publick odium and hatred.</p>
               <p n="11">11. When we perſwade you to counterplot the deſignes and endeavours of great ones, and Nobles, we underſtand ſuch who are unjuſt, and undertake ſomething, either againſt the ſtate of the Common-wealth, Religion, Juſtice, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Armies, or publick Treaſure; whom you muſt ſo meet with, and prevent, that it may appear to all good men, whom it concerns, that you are not acted therein by any private provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but by an honeſt care of the Common-wealth onely.</p>
               <p n="12">12. If you would have an example for your imitation, I ſhall name Cardinall <hi>Ximenes,</hi> who was choſen by <hi>Iſabella</hi> Queen of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Nobility, who then were not ſo ſubject to Kingly command, as at this day. From being a <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Monk, he was made the Queen's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115933:29"/>and afterwards, by the counſell of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Mendoza,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Toledo;</hi> and laſtly Inquiſior of the faith; and acted with great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity amongſt the Spaniards, and (being the chief Commiſſioner in the raigne of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> after that in the Raigne of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and at laſt when the Empire deſcended to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth) conteſted ſo with the Nobles, that he held both Prince and people ever devoted and addicted to him.</p>
               <p n="13">13. It was reported that he died by Poyſon, and himſelfe was ſuſpected; but the thing could never be proved, and therefore his death may be more rightly imputed to aged nature (for he was very old when he deceaſed). And nothing hindereth but that he may be believed to have maintained, and kept his owne fortune (which moſtly he ought to himſelfe and his owne endeavours) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and flouriſhing even to the laſt moment.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The ſame fortune attended not upon <hi>Cicho Simoneta,</hi> who when <hi>Franciſcus Sfortia</hi> and after him <hi>Galeacius</hi> his ſonne, poſſeſſed the City of <hi>Millane</hi> in Lumbardy under the widow-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Galeacius</hi> (who was young and under age) was ſet to oppoſe the brothers and heires, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his truſt and prudence; and being beloved for his mannagement of affaires.</p>
               <p n="15">15. He, that he might preſerve the Empire and Command for his pupill, thruſt out the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of <hi>Galeacius,</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> de. <hi>Santo Severino</hi> from the citty of <hi>Millane.</hi> But imagine what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy he underwent, and alſo how lewdly he was ſoon after deſtituted and forſaken: for the widow-Mother returning into favour with her adverſary made <hi>Simoneta</hi> the price and reward of her amity
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115933:29"/>and friendſhip with them; by whom being a long time detained in priſon, he periſhed miſerably tortured and quartered by them. Learne hence, how cautelouſly one ought to truſt princes whom you did not ſufficiently know to be conſtant. Such will proſtitute their Miniſters for a leight matter, to the luſt and will of their very enemies.</p>

                     <hi>A Second Third and Fourth kind of Nobles or Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and the reaſon why each of them ought to be eſteemed and allured.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THere are ſome Nobles (as we ſaid before) gracious indeed with the Prince, yet live without the dignity of office and charge. Theſe if they contribute not to confirme and ſettle us, yet may procure us ſo much favour with the Prince, whereby it may be done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are alſo uſefull by commemorating our merits, or, if need be, to excuſe our failings; and by protecting us againſt the Calumnies, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate accuſations, and detractions of others; who (if they be benevolent) may much advantage us; if irritated and offended, may much hurt and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy us. Wherefore the favour of ſuch is to be purchaſed by any means, at leaſt ſuch as are not unbefitting, or below our condition. You may imagine that theſe are not ſo daily tied up to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Princes domeſtick cuſtomes and uſes; but that ſometimes they look abroad to others.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115933:30"/>And although they have not imployment or office and charge, nevertheleſſe thoſe whom they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, (if not otherwiſe unworthy, or ungratefull to the Prince, or unfit to undergo imployments) are ſeldome deſpiſed, ſometimes preferred before others, who (though not unequall in deſerving) are yet deſtitute of ſuch friends and aſſiſtants.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third ſort we have ſpoken of, are ſuch who being adorned with great Authority in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, are yet but meanly favoured by the Prince. Theſe are found eſpecially with ſuch Princes who live peaceably, and mind their pleaſures being careleſſe of publique affaires, and therefore (committing the government to one or other who are faithfull), become averſe to hard and difficult buſineſſe, out of a feare of their importance and weight.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In ſuch a juncture of affaires, you ought to be more ſtudious in ſeeking the favour of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of State, then of the chief Ruler; for he will permit them whom he intruſteth with the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of government, to chooſe and delegate others to offices: for it would ſeeme weakneſſe in him to chooſe any for officers, whom himſelfe knowes not to be fit for imployment.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There are other Princes, who being more te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious and ſtedfaſt to their government and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, themſelves conſtitute Officers of State, yet admit them not to their familiar Converſe and Acquaintance, nor to their preſence, unleſſe ſome weighty buſineſs be in agitation, nor intruſt them with the dipenſing, and beſtowing of Offices, out of miſtruſt and jealouſie leſt their power by the multitude of Clients and Attendants, ſhould am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115933:30"/>and riſe to ſuch a heighth, as that from thence, (if they ſhould offend) they cannot be taken downe and dejected. The old cuſtome of ſuch Princes hath been to hold ſuch Miniſters under ſome kind of awe, and to give them ground to believe, that the pile and Bulwarke, which they by their labour in ſo long time have been building, may with one winck of his eyes be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. 'Tis very hard to perceive how you ſhould carry your ſelfe towards ſuch great Ones, whoſe power is ſo circumſcribed and limitted: their good will may not much benefit you; perhaps (if the Prince perceive it), it may prejudice you: And being without it, you will more hardly come to the mannaging of your buſineſs; and you will ſometimes be even inforced and neceſſitated, not without hazzard, to concurre with them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Here will need very much circumſpect courteſie and mildneſs; you muſt treat them with all the offices and duties of veneration, and civill deportment: and upon occaſion teſtifie (though warily) your ſecret promptitude and readineſſe of mind. Meane while, neglect not to ſeek out another Trumpeter or ſpokeſman who may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and underprop thee, and ſo thou mayeſt be more cloſely joyned with, and notified to, the Prince.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Such Nobles remaine to be ſpoken of, who are prevalent both in reſpect of favour, with the Prince, and alſo in regard of office: theſe (in brief) are to be honored almoſt equally with the Prince.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The inclinations and will of ſuch, are to be inſpected and looked into, and ought to be known
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115933:31"/>and executed, next after the Princes.</p>
               <p n="10">10. After this manner therefore, the power and authority of the great ones being (as by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees) ſubducted, you will not be ignorant what may be hoped for, and expected from them, for you muſt carefully beware, that you aske no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from any of them, which you or they ſee, cannot be effected: for there is nothing that more moleſteth humane ingenuity, then not to be of ability to ſatisfie the requeſt of one, whom a man loveth and affecteth.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Therefore benevolence, being preoccupated by uncivill ſupplication, or remedileſſe difficulty, is offended. And know, that he from whom you have ſuffered a Repulſe, will ſhun to ſee you, for feare, leſt by the impudency of ſuch a like requeſt, you put him to the bluſh, as if through defect of Authority and power, he could not do what you deſire.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But (this by the way may be added) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to the knowledge of great ones is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently open, it muſt be wrought by degrees. They who can do very much with them, whether Strangers, or Domeſticks, and their dependants and adherents, are to be allured, conſidering what abilities each of them hath, wherewith to advance and help others.</p>

                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Who thoſe Courtiers are, which are under the degree of Nobility, and what is to be done with them firſt: what is to be done with enemies which hate us for our friends ſakes, becauſe offended by them.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THere are others in Court, who (being ſet below the ranck of Nobles) are either our ſuperiors equalls or inferiours. And theſe are of two ſorts; ſome more apt and ready to benefit us, others to prejudice us. The Authority and power of both is diligently to be waighed and conſidered, as that, which may either promote, or impede, and hinder what we affect and ſue for. Their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and affinities alſo are to be pondered, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of times requiring that weact with them, by their owne ſervants and followers rather then by our ſelves, uſing their Counters to reckon our Game by; at leaſt, by them, deprecate and turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way envy from us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But firſt we muſt take heed, that we do not then onely ſeek their friendſhip, when we juſt need it; we ought to have it already prepared, and knit faſt by the pledges of ancient benevolence and good will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are three ſorts of thoſe who may hurt and hinder us; for they are either ſuch as are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or envious perſons, or elſe Competitors and Emulators.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They who are enemies, hare us either for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115933:32"/>our own ſakes, or for ſome of our friends ſakes who have offended them; but this laſt odium and hatred is for the moſt part leſſe ſharp then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and may be allayed, and mitigated, by ſome good office, whereby we may witneſs that we love our friends; but cannot forthwith hate all their Enemies.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But for the moſt part the friendſhips of Courtiers are factious, and cruell; and they will wiſh and adviſe you to abjure all familiarities which themſelves envy.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For this cauſe, ſome openly preferring the friendſhip of one party, have nevertheleſſe not failed to imbrace the other party ſecretly: not that ſo they might to betray their friend, but in in caſe he ſhould faile, provide a refuge for him.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Such prudence is not only happily and ſucceſsfully uſed in Court-conteſts, but alſo in Empires. <hi>Syenneſes</hi> being Vice-roy of <hi>Tarcis</hi> when the warre began between <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> fearing to oppugne and fight againſt <hi>Cyrus,</hi> imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his party, but ſent his Son to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> to be a refuge to his father, in caſe <hi>Cyrus</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Bardas Durus,</hi> having eſcaped from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Bardas Phocas</hi> was created Emperour againſt <hi>Baſilius</hi> ſought the amity of <hi>Phocas</hi> being as yet his enemy but ſent his Son (feigning that he fled away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his will) to follow <hi>Baſilius,</hi> and to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for his father in caſe <hi>Phocas</hi> were conquered: which alſo came to paſs.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Solon</hi> when the Common-wealth diſcorded,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115933:32"/>ordained that none ſhould be permitted <hi>Adiaphory</hi> or neutrality; nor do I think that 'twas his mind that friends imbracing contrary parties ſhould not ſend and return a meſſage to a private friend; but rather that he hoped, that friends following and purſuing divers ends, would then la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour more greedily and happily for publique peace.</p>
               <p n="10">10. After the ſame manner in Courts, although you be of a contrary faction, yet may you keep friendſhip with one that is of another faction, both to the end you may have a receptacle in a changed fortune, and alſo that you may be the fitter to reconcile minds inclining to milder things. There is no ſafer nor honeſter means and way to ingratiate your ſelf with either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending party, amongſt thoſe diſcords, and contentions that ariſe amongſt great Ones.</p>

               <argument>
                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How we muſt deale with ſuch who hate us for our our owne cauſe, and are offended with us: where alſo is intreated of Threats and Injuries.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THey who hate us for our ſelves, do it either becauſe they are offended with us; or elſe, (as is very familiar with great Ones towards their Inferiors and as the Italian Proverb hath it, <hi>Qui offendit, non condonet,</hi> He that gives the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, let him not forgive) becauſe they have
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115933:33"/>offended us. Minds ſwelling with great fortune have this fault chiefly. Whom they hurt, they hate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The beſt remedy for ſuch Injuries, as theſe do to us, is, If they be not underſtood and known; but if its weightineſſe ſhall give it a marke of an offence to us underſtood, let us ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate a mitigation of grief for it, and that the remembrance thereof is defaced and blotted out of our minds. Elſe, if they perceive us to bear it impatiently, we ſtrike into them a fear of our revengefulneſſe, and ſo, a deſire of preventing us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But chiefly let us forbear threats, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if we be not preſently prepared to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For threatnings rouze up the vigilancy of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, and do provoke them to hatred and to double the Injury, and often brings us to ſhame, if we breath out revenge, and have not power an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to our will.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I know this moderation is not approved by all men, chiefly, by ſuch as are revengefull; who are of opinion that no Injury is to be paſſed by without ſenſibility, not onely in regard of the ſweetneſſe which is in revenge, but alſo, becauſe that if you bear with an old Injury, you invite a new; and therefore think fit to proſecute with immortall hatred, thoſe who offend them. But ſuch, while they deſire to render themſelves for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, and dreadfull, produce this effect to themſelves, That no body will have Commerce with them. Sithence therefore, all are mortalls are prone to lapſe and digreſſe and ſo either affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115933:33"/>or through incogitancy and want of heed are carried away, let every one for fear of giving offence, ſhun thoſe who are ſo tenacious and ready to hate, even as wild and ſavage beaſts, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them to their own ſolitude. Laſtly, if he ſhall alſo oftend, he will yet expect all amicableneſs from the other party, and while he feares revenge, will deſire to inforce and ſtrike the firſt blow. Wherefore to avoid ſo many evills, I think it beſt to inſiſt rather and purſue the contrary way, and do prefer lenity and mildneſſe, which is not difficult, no not in the greateſt Injuries; reſpect being firſt had to the difference, both of the cauſe by which; and to the condition and quality of the perſons, by whom the Injuries is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For in lighter injuries, and ſuch as have their riſe rather from Perturbation and trouble of mind, then Malice, we ought to be ſo unoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as that we ſeem not to be at all ſenſible. If the injury be heinous, let us ſhew our ſelves carefull and tender of our reputation and eſteem; yet not be ſo implacable to the offending party, as not to leave him hope of reconciliation, and place for pardon in caſe of ſatisfaction. To which end, I judge it not unfit to complaine of the wrong to the friends of him who hath injuried us, and to commit the cauſe to their Arbitrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I am of opinion that thoſe wrongs which are inſultingly done, through malepertneſs and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulancy, and out of a humour to reproach, are forthwith to be vindicated, yet not ſo much with a deſire of revenge, as to chaſtiſe the offender,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115933:34"/>that ſo he may learn to demeane, and carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more modeſtly, not towards us only, but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others alſo.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Yet ſuch are not to be revenged on with implacable hatred; rather ought we to teſtifie our grief for the neceſſity of vindication which is laid upon us. And (after Amends and Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made) that we are ready according as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the treſpaſs will admit to redintegrate and renew our friendſhip and amity with them.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>BUt becauſe, ſuch abuſes are commonly put upon us by ſuch as overpower us; The firſt remedy to avoid theſe, is, not to deal with them but with much reverence, and reſpect, taking heed leſt they diſdain your familiarity with them, or (if they be more rough and auſtere) altogether decline to converſe with them. Notable is that that of Martial.</p>

                  <l>If ſhun thou wilt moſt bitter things,</l>
                  <l>From ſad remorſe ſecure thy mind.</l>
                  <l>To none become too much a friend;</l>
                  <l>Leſſe joy, leſſe grief thou then ſhalt find.</l>
               </lg>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond is not to prefer the ſenſibility of an injury before ones own ſafety: for, it is neither ſafe, nor is it a wiſe mans part, to ſtrive too much with one more powerfull then himſelf. Let the diſparity of abilities be a juſt pretext to excuſe thy diſguiſed Diſſimulation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I know that ſome perſwade themſelves that an adverſſary ſmitten with fear, will come and crouch and begge pardon and reconciliation; nor can it be denied but that ſome low and poore ſpirited ones, will ſometimes ſo farre debaſe themſelves, and ſtoop ſo low: but ſuch a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement and peace-making is but feigned, and will never prove ſincere. Nor do ſuch omit, (when occaſion is given to renew injury) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge and diſpenſe with their own minds; and by how much the more timorous and fearfull they find a man, by ſo much the more cruelly and outragiouſly will they aſpire and breath forth vengeance. Therefore ſince an occult and cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying enemy, is more difficult to be avoided, then an open and declared one, it is better (after ſome ſort) to have ſuch open enemies, then friends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled when enforced thereto by fear. I ſpeak of thoſe, who being not greater then ourſelves,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115933:35"/>of Amity be broke, they can doe us little harme.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For if we have to do with one greater then our ſelves whoſe Emnity may eclipſe our Luſtre, It were better to hold his affection redinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated, and renewed, though fictitious and feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly ſo, then to have him appear an open Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If we have been the firſt offenders, let us be firſt in appeaſing the party offended, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to themſelves, or by mediation of friends.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now that we may diſcern who are of moſt ample ability to ſuppreſſe and hinder us, it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, not only to conſider their power, but their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, by which (beſides their hatred) they are carried to do us hurt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For ſome are acted by a deſire of hatred, (the Piedee and Laquey of revenge) others by fear, leſt having gotten and obtained what we proſecuted, we ſhould thereby bee better armed to prejudice and offend them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That firſt and worſt affection is violent, but that of fear is more violent, for Court oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but that enemy, who, beſides this, is ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated alſo by that other, is the moſt inevitable.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The former may be mitigated, by humble and ſatisfactory ſervices; but the timorous will ſcarce ever be perſwaded, to change his fear into a conſidence, and aſſurance of your benevolence towards him; yet this muſt be aſſayed by all means, which occaſion and opportunity will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give him to underſtand, then any inſtruction or diſcipline.</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:115933:35"/>10. <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> that he might make them his friends again, whom he had offended, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more them to the moſt honourable places and offices; in the adminiſtration whereof, when they had incurred envy, (as is commonly ſeen) the accuſed are conſtrained to fly to the Prince, who delivering them from hazard and infamy, obliges them by this good turn, to become his ſincere friends.</p>
               <p n="11">11. It is a very familiar artifice, and ſubtle trick uſed in Courts, to ſupplant and remove a man ſecretly, that ſo thou being advanced by this kindneſſe and good office of his, maiſt be the more ſtrictly engaged and obliged to him.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Not leſſe frequent in Court is that dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and to be avoided craft and wilineſſe, of <hi>Eutrapelus Horatianus,</hi> who was wont to lend mony to men, to ſupply their luxury, and would puff up the minds of thoſe, whom he intended to accommodate, with a good round ſum.</p>
               <p n="13">13. In like manner, they who applaud and allow us in our pleaſures, affections, and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and adviſe us to undertake ſuch things, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed our ſtrength and abilities, (which alſo they extoll beyond deſert) or ſuch things as are againſt reaſon, do moſt-what go about to hurry us to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and deſtruction.</p>
               <p n="14">14. But let us return to the means of renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friendſhip with Enemies, amongſt which, this is in no wiſe the laſt, or leaſt, <hi>viz.</hi> to aſſiſt the wiſhes and endeavours of an Enemy, both by counſell and endeavour, when you ſee that you cannot impede and hinder their ſucceſs that ſo he may ſeem to be engaged to love by your good turnes.</p>
               <p n="15">
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:115933:36"/>15. By this means <hi>Aſcanius Sforcia</hi> the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, obſerving, that he in vain interceded and went about, to hinder the machinations and plots of <hi>Julian</hi> the Cardinall, who laboured to advance <hi>John,</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth, to the Cardinall-dignity, did afterwards ſo affectedly act on <hi>Johns</hi> ſide, that he obtained it for him; and after that, became a greater favourit to him, than <hi>Julian</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p n="16">16. If the ſtubbornneſſe of the enemy fruſtrate all endeavours of reconciliation, we muſt at laſt obſerve, whether our adverſary hath not ſome other, whom he envies, and fears more then our ſelves; if ſo, and he ſeem to proſecute the ſame deſigne, which we do, you may ſo deal with the adverſary by a friend, that though his hate be equally prevalent towards both; yet may he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther favour or leſſe hurt and obſtruct our party.</p>
               <p>A device, not unlike to this, was that uſed by <hi>Gerlachus,</hi> the Biſhop and Elector of <hi>Mentz;</hi> when he intended to create <hi>Adolfus Naſſovius</hi> his kinſman, Emperour. He knew, that there was variance between the Princes, who were very likely to get, or elſe deſigned for, the Empire then vacant: He deals with the Electors, (whom he was about to make uſe of for his purpoſe) pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately and apart: He admoniſheth <hi>Vinceſlaus,</hi> then King of the Bohemians, that moſt of the ſuffrages and votes of the Electors, went againſt <hi>Albertus</hi> Duke of <hi>Auſtria, Vinceſlaus</hi> his enemy; nevertheleſſe he himſelf was ready to hinder and ſtop it, if he perceived, that <hi>Vinceſlaus</hi> conſented. Having perſwaded <hi>Vinceſlaus,</hi> he ſets upon the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and reports to him, that the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115933:36"/>
                  <hi>Duke</hi> of Brunſwick (his adverſary) was the next in hope to atchieve the buſineſs. But to the <hi>Palatine</hi> he boaſteth leſt he ſhould be hindered, that <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſlaus</hi> (who then was offended with the <hi>Palatinate</hi>) unleſſe he were hindered, was neerer to it then the reſt. Thus (every one promiſing to ſubvert his enemy) he circumvents them all, and at laſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates his kinſman, who (if he had mentioned him before), would doubtleſs have been rejected by conſent of all parties.</p>

                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:115933:37"/>3. To this end, it behooveth us to get into their friendſhip and familiarity; and to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to them, That although they be manifeſtly envious, yet we do well affect them; affirming that we will all things as they will them, nor go we about any thing whatever but that thereby we may be the fitter to ſerve our friends, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves amongſt them. In brief; we muſt ſo act, that they may conceive hopes of increaſing their owne fortunes, by the augments and amplifyings of our wealth and ſubſtance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. All haughtineſs of mind, too great exceedings in coſtlineſs, unreaſonable feaſts &amp; banquettings; and laſtly, all boaſting and bragging, are chiefly to be ſhunned by ſuch, who will be cautious of being Envyed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Eſpecially by ſuch as are raiſed from a mean place and office, unleſſe the will of the Prince or the dignity of Office require the contrary: for then ſome Magnificence and ſumptuous proviſion will not be unbeſeeming, ſo that he manifeſt that he is not at ſuch coſt for his owne pleaſure, but in obedience to the Princes Command.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By ſuch prudence and moderation, began Cardinall <hi>Ximenes</hi> in a principall City: he was borne in an obſcure and unknowne place, and t'was uncertaine whether nob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> or not; although his fortune afterwards found thoſe, who would affirme him noble. When he was but meane, he became a Monk; afterwards for his Endowment of mind, made confeſſor to <hi>Iſabella</hi> Queen of <hi>Caſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> upon the recommendation of Cardinall <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doza,</hi> and laſtly Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> which Arch-Biſhoprick (when <hi>Mendoza</hi> was dead)
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115933:37"/>
                  <hi>Iſabella</hi> having obtained from the Pope) he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe unfit for envy, would not accept.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In refuſing whereof he was ſo pertinacious, and head-ſtrong, that though <hi>Iſabelia</hi> had ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſubjected all the Court-Nobles he would ſcarce ſuffer himſelfe to be intreated to accept of, and undertake the charge and office. And after he had conſented and accepted, there was need againe of other intreaties, by which he might be induced to more ample charges and offices, and ſuch ſplendor as befitted his dignity. And ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive was he of his former way of life, that he was no otherwiſe wrought upon, to any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then by the Authority even of the Pope himſelfe. This modeſty wrought well for him, and he appeaſed the Envy which otherwiſe was certainly to be expected to one, who poſſeſſed dignity, environed with ſo many noble Spaniards, and wealth ſecond onely to that of kings.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Laſtly this way of acting, as it is a notable and excellent Amulet and preſervative-Poman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der againſt Envy, under the beginnings of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: ſo it little advantageth thoſe, who have once already carried themſelves proudly; for ſuch Moderation will ſeeme but feigned. An example whereof the hiſtory of Conſtantinople will afford. A certaine Metropolitane, by name <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> being expelled the Court of <hi>Iſaciaus Angelus,</hi> and afterwards of <hi>Alexius,</hi> the Emperours, returned with <hi>Euphroſyne</hi> the Empreſſe, boaſted of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine of buſineſs, and a Court life, took upon him the function of a Deacon; by which to credit his diſſimulation, and that he might the more inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be courted and intreated thereto. But, in briefe,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115933:38"/>he ſo craftily played his Cards, that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour himſelfe ſent for him to Court, contrary to the ordinances of the Church, he being excluded from the Sacrament of Prieſt-hood, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to great offices; and (not content with his owne dignity) he brought two brothers to be at the Emperours elbow, to ſupply his abſence, if at any time by buſineſſe of great moment he ſhould be called aſide. But becauſe his former fortune had too much diſcloſed his inſolency; therefore now, although ſeemingly modeſt, could he not long be credited, but afterwards being removed from Court, and never reſtored, he dyed.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THe ſame remedies which do change Envy into the better, do alſo prevaile againſt Emulation which indeed hath leſſe malignity in it then Envy hath, but more ambition; and is not leſſe treacherous againſt the gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. But we may aveſt and turne aſide thoſe who are inflamed with ambition, by a ſpecious ſhew of veneration, and allure and delight them with vain honours; leſt they become Competitiours with us, ſcruing up their hopes to higher things and aſſiſting them as far as is lawfull. On the contrary,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115933:38"/>undervaluing the things we affect and aime at, as below their Merits, yet ſufficient for us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, as not having equall Hopes with them of greater.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If there be any feare that they ſhould get before us, they may be ſtopt by injecting a doubt, which may be done, if (arguments being propoſed on both ſides,) the greater ſpecies and ſhew be added to thoſe things, which are moſt apt to ſtop, and retard their ambitious courſes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But of all courſes, that were beſt, if we could conceal our deſignes till the Emulous, or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded parties have clapſed their time, wherein they could have ſtopped and hindred us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſuite of ſuch as ſolicite too openly, is often odious to thoſe, who acting more modeſtly take time to turne themſelves in, and to conſider they alſo have a conflict with greater difficulties, and are expoſed to more Envy if they overcome; but if otherwiſe, to more reproach.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Farr ſafer is it (as is ſaid in number 4.) to ſuppreſſe and conceale adviſements, and like water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men rowing in a boat to turne the back upon the place they ſtrive to land at.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They who have canvaſſed for the greateſt Empires, have ſteered this Courſe, nothing being more uſuall with them, than that (in <hi>Euripides</hi> his Tragedy) example of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> to boaſt that his deſires tended rather to peace, then hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours. And many have been ſenſible, that this hath been the moſt wholeſome remedy, and Antidote, in turning aſide the plots of adverſaries, and avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Infamy, which abides theſe fruſtrated, and earneſt Suitors. And at laſt they have attained
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115933:39"/>that glory, that their honour ſeemeth rather to be conferred on them by their own merits, then by flattering ſuffrages and votes of others.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Laſtly, in atchieving honours; this chiefly muſt we take heed to, that we ſtrive not with any one who is greater then our ſelves, and more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent then they, under whom we ſhelter our ſelves. <hi>Manilius Lepidus</hi> a man in the judgment of <hi>Tacitus</hi> moſt wiſe, will then be worthy our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, who being brought into the Senate by <hi>Tiberius</hi> with <hi>Junius Bleſus,</hi> Uncle to <hi>Sejanus,</hi> that one of them might be choſen Proconſul of <hi>Africa,</hi> excuſeth himſelf with his owne unheal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, the age of his Children, &amp; that his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was marriageable, fearing doubtleſs that <hi>Seja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> would become his Enemy, if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince had been taken before hand from <hi>Bleſus.</hi> Annal 3.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Neither may we ſtrive too obſtinately with one, whom the Prince more propitiouſly favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring goeth about to advance, although the law favoureth us againſt him. For the Law doubtleſs is overcome by favour, as the Hiſtorian tells us, was formerly done, when <hi>Germanicus</hi> and <hi>Druſus</hi> created <hi>Haterus Agrippa,</hi> the kinſman of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus, Praetor, non obſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <argument>
                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How ruine is to be avoided, when it is imminent; how it may be handled. Examples of ſuch as have fallen by their power.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. Hitherto we have diſpatched the chief pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, which a politique man is to obſerve. If any remain, every ones prudence and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity may ſupply them. And although they ſerve not only to acquire and get, but alſo, to keep and maintain Courtly power; yet will it not be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, to have in readineſſe the examples of ſuch who have fallen by their power and greatneſſe; that we may be wiſe by others perils, and if we cannot ſhun ruine, at leaſt we may learn to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our ſelves for it. For this laſt is not leſſe neceſſary then the other. Sithence he who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoureth a flight, of times aſſayeth in vain; he who prepares for a fall (inevitable to moſt whom fortune mounteth on high) renders it the more gentle and ſupportable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such chances often happen, either by our own default, or by the Arts, and devices of envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Enemies or Competitors, or by the perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Princes inclination, or finally, by his death.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Since all mens lives are prone to lapſe and repleat with errors, chiefly theirs, who live lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, and by reaſon of their Authority (by which they who are neer to them, are conſtrained to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115933:40"/>all their Actions, whether good or bad) are ſet without, and beyond the chance of the Dice, and danger of reprehenſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But above all others, that's the baſeſt treaſon when men riſe up againſt their Prince, the Author of their dignity and honour, a note and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an ungratefull mind and unfaithfulneſſe, a filthy crime, and the moſt juſt matter and ſubject of a Prince's Odium and indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let ſuch men as are advanced to great dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, fly the very ſhadow and appearance of this wickedneſſe: and for that end, let them not move the Prince to the leaſt ſuſpition, and let them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline thoſe honours which may ſeem opportune, and ſeaſonable, by evill endeavours.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Paterculus</hi> adjudged <hi>Sejanus</hi> the moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of Courtiers; and indeed he ought to have been ſo, who could flouriſh in favour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſame crafty, and diſtruſtfull <hi>Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. In acting (ſaith he) he was like one aſleep revengefull of nothing done to himſelf, and ſo obtaining all things, ſcruing himſelfe into the eſteem of others; calme and undiſturbed in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and life, but reſtleſs in mind. And yet on this crafty and ſubtill peece had Ambition ſo got hold, that he aſpired to the Empire. For that end firſt he deſired intermarriage with <hi>Livia</hi> the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of <hi>Druſus,</hi> whereby being allyed to the houſe of the <hi>Caſars,</hi> he might the more faciliate his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. And although his requeſt was ſuſpected by <hi>Tiberius,</hi> as he might gueſſe by his tergiverſation and refuſall; he never yet changed his minde: but
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115933:40"/>becauſe this ſucceeded not, he attempted another way.</p>
               <p n="8">8. He well knew that the City diſdained <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and therefore, while he was wavering, he eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth him forward, and perſwades him to betake himſelf to <hi>Capreas</hi> his magnificent Tower neer <hi>Naples.</hi> Of this matter, <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the fourth of his Annals, ſaith thus. Leaſt by driving away the troops which dayly came to his houſe, he ſhould infringe his power, or by receiving them, give way to criminations, be bent this way, to force <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> to live in pleaſant and delightfull places, far remote from <hi>Rome.</hi> He provided many things, he held addreſſes and acceſſes in his own hands; he intercepted Letters often which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to and fro by the Souldiers; when as <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> growing into years, and lying quiet, and at eaſe in a ſecret place, would, he thought, ere long, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the charge of the Empire to him with more facility. Nor did his hope altogether deceive him, for in ſhort ſpace, under the ſhew of helping <hi>Tiberius</hi> in his old age, he got almoſt all the ſtrength of the Empire into his owne hands.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Nevertheleſs, that this way which <hi>Sejanus</hi> tooke had more of hazard in it then expedition, the Sequel will declare: which more exactly to commemorate will be a worke well worthy our labour, to the end that both our Courtiers may be better cautionated, in ruling and governing their own fortunes; and Princes in promoting of others.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Sejanus</hi> was either more indeered unto, or more endured by <hi>Tiberius,</hi> when he found his help
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115933:41"/>uſefull in repreſſing <hi>Agrippina,</hi> and her ſons <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> and <hi>Druſus.</hi> In which villany, <hi>Sejanus</hi> ſhewed himſelf very prompt and ready, knowing that thereby he ſhould not only hoiſe up ſayle, and have a ſpeedy voyage to the Prince's favour, but alſo eſtabliſh his hopes for future power and greatneſs, there being none remaining of <hi>Caeſar's</hi> houſe but thoſe two youths; whoſe tender Age, if they had accepted the chief Regiment and Government, had left to him the Authority and mannagement of affairs, till opportunity would ſerve him, to uſurpe and poſſeſs the Supream ſtyle and Title.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But obſerve how precipitate and heady Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition makes men! He ſees not by that how much the neerer he was to the height, by ſo much the more was he ſuſpected by the diffidency of the Prince; and that the courſe he takes would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diminiſh him, then further his progreſſe. He hunts counter; for when nothing, ſave the name of Emperour (which yet many were ready to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him) and the power of a Triune, (which title being the top and Pinacle of Honour and dignity, the Emperours did challenge as due ſoly to themſelves) was wanting to him; not content therewith, he ſtrives to exaggerate and heape up his power, to a greater bulke and breadth; And by this (as he renders himſelf venerable to all, ſo) he brought himſelf under ſuſpect with <hi>Tiberius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. He therefore, when he perceived that not only the Praetorian bands, but many of the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Principall Families, (partly by benefits and hope, and partly by fear) were addicted and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115933:41"/>devoted to <hi>Sejanus;</hi> and that his own ſecrets were carried, and diſcloſed by his own domeſticks to <hi>Sejanus,</hi> and the like not done to him of the matters of <hi>Sejanus;</hi> by and by, plotted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived his ruine and deſtruction, as of an Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and one contending to outvie him. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would ſet upon any action, thought fit to try how ſome ſtood affected towards him, that ſo he might diſtinguiſh from the reſt, who would approve his deſigne and adviſe him in it.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And leſt <hi>Sejanus</hi> ſhould ſmell out <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi> intention, he makes him a Conſul, and in his preſence, and alſo by Letters to the Stateſmen and people, ſtyles him his friend in Labours; at length feigneth himſelf ſick, that ſo he might ſound the affection of <hi>Sejanns,</hi> and others towards him.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Sometimes he writes to the Senate more cheerfully of his health, and that he would come ſhortly into the City. Sometimes commends and applaudes <hi>Sejanus;</hi> another while depreſſeth him; receiving ſome upon his recommendation; ſpurning at others, that ſo he might keep him ambiguous, and doubtfull betwixt hope and fear.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Who, (whether yet imboldned by favour, or out of fear) determines to act nothing forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, leſt he ſhould hazard all his hopes, hoping that his petty treſpaſſes againſt the Prince (if any were) would in time be raced and blotted out of memory. Some, mean while hitherto follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather <hi>Sejanus</hi> his fortune then himſelf, ſeeing the mutability of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> begin to act more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115933:42"/>the affection of others towards him by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little, withers and growes ſtale.</p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>Tiberius,</hi> having a good while ſince taken a clear proſpect of the proud and lofty mind of <hi>Sejanus;</hi> and alſo miſtruſting, leſt his deſigne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtirred up by contempt, ſhould be fruſtrated, by running the hazard of fortune and chance, commanded, it ſhould be noiſed abroad, that he intended to deliver over the Tribunician power and authority to <hi>Sejanus.</hi> A little while after, by Letters to the Senate, which were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by <hi>Macro,</hi> (who was Provoſt of the Pretorian Bands) he commands him to be committed to priſon. <hi>Macro</hi> having entred the City, before day, acquainted firſt <hi>Memmius Regulus,</hi> then a Conſul, (for the other Conful was more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Sejanus</hi>) with the Prince's mandat, which afterwards he ſhewes to <hi>Grecinus Laco,</hi> then Captain of the Watch. From thence going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Senate-houſe, he accidentally acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth <hi>Sejanus,</hi> who being troubled in his thoughts, enquires whether he had any Letters for him from <hi>Tiberius:</hi> He whiſpereth him in the ear, that by and by he muſt be ſaluted a Tribune; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tickled with ſecret joy, enters the Court. <hi>Macro</hi> diſmiſſes the Pretorian Attendants, ſhews by Letters, that it is the Emperours pleaſure it ſhould be ſo, and that thereby they are promiſed a donative. <hi>Macro</hi> having ordained <hi>Laco</hi>'s Band to the Pretorian Attendants, who were now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed, entring the Senate-houſe, offers the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and anon, (not expecting the reading of them) charges <hi>Laco</hi> diligently to watch, leſt <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>janus</hi> breaking out of the Court, ſhould raiſe a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115933:42"/>tumult, himſelf going to the Pretorian Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, and prohibites them from attempting any thing.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The Letters which were then read being ſomewhat large, afforded <hi>Macro</hi> time enough, to provide neceſſaries, and were wonderfully inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced and contrived. In the beginning, not a word of <hi>Sejanus,</hi> but of other matters; by and by hee's nipt, but very lightly; after this, (ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things being interwoven) followes a high accuſation; and yet but perfunctorily and ſleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touched. At length, (after many digreſſions about the publick affairs) two of <hi>Sejanus</hi> his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars are nominated, whom the Senate are commanded to animadvert and conſider, with this addition, that he himſelf ſhould be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended; no mention was made of any courſe to be taken for his death, that ſo, hopes might be left to the accuſed, to purge him of the crimes, which were therefore objected but as leight matters.</p>
               <p n="18">18. The Letters being read, many of thoſe who had brought him into the Senate-houſe, (when they perceived the buſineſſe to be far otherwiſe, then that <hi>Sejanus</hi> ſhould receive the power of a Tribune) began to riſe up, and encompaſſed <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>janus,</hi> leſt he ſhould ſlink away, which was thought he would have done, if the beginning of the Letters had thundred more ſharply againſt him. But contemning thoſe petty and ſleight nips and twinges, he ſtirrs not from his place; and being called upon twice or thrice by <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> the Conſul, he ſcarcely ſubmitted; ſo inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and haughty was he grown.</p>
               <p n="19">
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:115933:43"/>19. When he was riſen up, <hi>Laco</hi> firſt followes him; afterwards <hi>Regulus,</hi> accompanied with other of the Senators, brought him out of the Court into the Priſon, where afterwards he was condemned by the Senate, <hi>ad ſcalas Gemonias,</hi> which was a place appointed, from whence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned men were thrown down.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Behold here the end and deſtruction of a Courtier, who had ſcarce his peer within the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of man, for craftineſſe and power; whoſe ſtructure and building, although as to the whole, and continuance of it, ſeems to be due to <hi>Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> yet may rather be aſcribed to the deſtiny of ſuch power, as commonly, by reaſon of its own heap and bigneſſe, falls ſo much the lower, by how much the higher and loftier it thruſts up it ſelf; according to that ſaying, <hi>Tolluntur in altum &amp; lapſu graviore ruant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21. This may be learnt from the example of <hi>Peren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> whom (ſtriving to get up to this height by <hi>Seianus</hi> his Arts and devices) <hi>Commodus,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though farre inferiour to <hi>Tiberius</hi> in ingenuity and witt, ſubverted and overthrew.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Perhaps theſe relations may not move ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men, becauſe they ſeeme to themſelves to bee wiſer then others, and to know ſome things which was unknown to thoſe whoſe chances are here related; And truly, there have been ſome in theſe latter Ages, to whom this buſineſſe hath ſucceeded not altogether ſo unhappily, ſuch as <hi>Boyla</hi> was, (of whom we may reade in the Hiſtory of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>) who being found to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired againſt <hi>Conſtantine, Monomachus</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, ſuffered not ſuch exquiſite, and heavy pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115933:43"/>as others in like caſes had done, becauſe he fell into the hands of a mild and placable Prince.</p>
               <p n="23">23. But we are willing here briefly to recite that ſtory, from which may be underſtood, That Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells even the moſt ſecret, and ſuch as to humane eyes are not paſſable, oftimes by divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and even by unhoped for meanes are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and diſcovered, and cannot avoid their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, although handled with never ſo much craftineſſe and ſubtilty.</p>
               <p n="24">24. No mortall could have beleeved, that this <hi>Boyla</hi> had had, either aptitude and fitnes, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent cauſe for ſuch a villany. The greatneſſe of the benefits wherewith hee had adorned and beautified him, had wrought an opinion in the Prince of his fidelity, for otherwiſe he ſeemed ſimple to any great matters; for he was not only borne in a low and meane place, but alſo was of ſuch a buffling, fumbling, and cumbred ſpeech, that he could ſcarce be underſtood, and when he perceived that it delighted the Emperor, he afterwards induſtriouſly affected it.</p>
               <p n="25">25. By this aſſentation and ſoothing, he ſo far inſinuated into the Prince's familiarity, that he had admittance even to the privy, and bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> At length, being enriched by the Prince, and elected into the number of the Senators, he began to ſhute out his hopes to a higher flight, and went ſo far, that he thought, by the ruine and deſtruction of the Prince, he might find a way to the Scepter it ſelf. He firſt opens himſelf to thoſe, whom he knew were offended with the Prince, and promiſeth largely to thoſe,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115933:44"/>who approve and aſſociate their aids, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the refuſers for their good-will to their Prince, and made ſhew, as if he were but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorator, and private ſpy, to try their faithfulneſs and loyalty.</p>
               <p n="26">26. While theſe things were in agitation, he ſhunned the conſcience of all men, ſave thoſe whom he feared not; and had done the bloody act, had he not been diſcovered by one of his own comerades and counſellors, and by his art depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, having the very weapon in his hand, which he had ſharpned to kill the Prince withall. The Emperour bore the injury ſo mildly, that he accounted it enough, that ſome of the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were put to death; but the Ring-leader and Captain he onely baniſhed.</p>
               <p n="27">27. It would be too tedious, to bring in here all thoſe, who in Courts have been ſhipwrackt; ſuch, I ſay, as by ſuch offences have merited pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; and which have hapned, not onely to the manifeſt authors of ſuch wickedneſſe, but even to ſuch, as have been ſuſpected of the thoughts thereof. But we'l content our ſelves, with producing theſe, and onely add this, That all Pride, whether it offend the Prince by ambition, or boaſting, upbraiding, malediction, or revile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; by ſplendour, or too great a retinue, is the high road to deſtruction and ruine.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Bragging and boaſting before the Prince, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and twitting with offices, liberty, arrogancy, too much familiarity, pride, vanity, avarice, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſneſſe, conſpiracy, ſowing of diſſention and ſtrife, are every one of them denoted by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>BOaſting and upbraiding of Offices, in the Court of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, loſt <hi>Philotas</hi> and <hi>Clytus; Craterus</hi> alſo, was almoſt blown up with the ſame winds. Certes, he had longer ſtood affected with the Prince, had he contained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf within the bounds of noble and generous modeſty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thus <hi>Caius Sylius</hi> with <hi>Tiberius: Antonius</hi> the firſt, with <hi>Veſpaſian; Syllas</hi> with King <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa,</hi> publiſhing aforehand their offices and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, deprived themſelves of all the fruit and benefit of them; concerning the firſt of whom, <hi>Tacitus,</hi> in the 4 th. of his Annalls; and <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his 4 th. Hiſtory, touching the laſt, are to be inſpected and looked into.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Princes believe, that their fortune is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, by ſuch kind of boaſtings; which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune they will have ſeem to be due to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not to the merits or vertue of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A luſt and deſire of reprehending the actions of Princes, and a freedom of inveighing
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115933:45"/>againſt others before the Prince, is to be avoided, as the neighbour to arrogancy. <hi>Eumenes,</hi> petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly and ſaucily, complaining before <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of <hi>Hepheſtion,</hi> that he aſſigned to Stage-play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſuch kind of fellowes, the Souldiers quarters, incurred the diſpleaſure of the King.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To be too familiarly buſie about the Prince, or to boaſt ones ſelf, the ſole Arbittator and Commiſſioner of principall charges, ſavoureth, if not of pride, yet certainly vanity; and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe ſometimes crouds it ſelf in with it. Many examples of ſuch are extant every where, in Hiſtories. How immodeſtly did <hi>Zotirus</hi> demean and carry himſelf, under <hi>Heliogbalus?</hi> how did <hi>Turinus</hi> under <hi>Alexander,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Mammea?</hi> One whereof was by the Emperour's command ſuffocated with ſmoak, uſing a more uncouth and harſh fortune then the former, it ſeeming juſt, <hi>ut, qui fumum vendiderat, fumo puniretur,</hi> That he who had vended and ſold ſmoak, ſhould periſh by ſmoak. The other was wont to boaſt, that the Prince was ruled by his advice, and alſo made advantage, by ſelling favours, when the courteſie was no way advantagious to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Worthy in the firſt place to be remembered, is the arrogancy of <hi>Plancianus,</hi> which alſo was accompanied with vanity, and at length broke out into treachery: He was of that arrogancy, that he durſt oppoſe himſelf againſt <hi>Baſſianus,</hi> the Emperours ſon, the author of his dignity and fortune: Moreover alſo, ſo vain, that paſſing through the City, he would not onely preclude others from addreſſes to him, but almoſt from
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115933:45"/>having a view of him; and had ſome to go before him, to turn thoſe whom they met, out of his way. At length proved traitor to his Prince; and being found guilty of manifeſt conſpiracy, loſt his head for his pains.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Philip</hi> the fair reigning in <hi>France, Enguer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus Marigny,</hi> preſuming to confront <hi>Carolus Valeſius,</hi> how miſerably he periſhed, together with others, is obſerved out of the French Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Before all things alſo in Courts, we ought to beware, that we lend not our help to the ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of diſcord amongſt Princes; for they being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to each other, do moſtly ſacrifice ſuch perſons to their friendſhip. Which thing is made good, both by many examples, in the Hiſtories of all Nations, and alſo by that memorable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Otho Crondorferus,</hi> which the Hiſtory of <hi>Bavaria</hi> ſupplies us withal. He was in flouriſhing favour with <hi>Radulphus</hi> the Palatine, and was the author of the enmities between him and his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: At length, the mother ingratiates her ſelf with her ſon; but <hi>Crondorferus</hi> was rewarded, with the loſſe and deprivation, both of his tongue and eyes.</p>

                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How a man may conſerve the Prince's benevolence, and the good will of ſuch as are in favour with him.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. WE ought not therefore to croſſe or reſiſt Princes themſelves onely, but even not ſuch as are in favour with them, and are more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent then ourſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Counſell <hi>Germanicus</hi> when he dyed gave to <hi>Agrippina;</hi> whereof <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſpeakes in the 2. of his Annals, thus: Then turning to his wife (ſayeth he) he intreateth her by the memory of himſelfe, and the Children they had between them, that ſhe ſhould put off cruelty and fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſubmit her mind to rigorous fortune; leaſt returning back to the City, ſhe ſhould ſtirre up, and provoke, ſuch as were more powerfull then herſelfe, through emulation. This precept being ſleighted by <hi>Agrippina,</hi> ruined both her, and her children. We ſpake a little before, of that which was the diminution and ſhortning of <hi>Eumenes</hi> his favour with <hi>Alexander,</hi> that behaving himſelfe too irreverently and unſeemly in the Prince's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, when he came to complain of <hi>Hephaeſtion,</hi> he even wove himſelfe, (through the Complaint) into the web of Envy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore, when we ſee any one flouriſh by the grace and favour of the Prince; we ought carefully to waigh our Authority, if we have
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115933:46"/>any, in the ballance with theirs, and try whoſe is moſt ponderous. And in the Examen and tryall thereof, not to attend ſo much to the externall ſpecies and ſhadow; but to the importance and waight of interiour and inward cauſes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Craterus</hi> and <hi>Hephaeſtion</hi> ſeemed once to be both in great and equall favour with <hi>Alexander,</hi> till <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelfe made the difference; when he calls the one, <hi>Amicum Regis,</hi> the friend of the King; the other <hi>Amicum Alexandri</hi> the friend of <hi>Alexander;</hi> for upon this ſpeech, <hi>Craterus</hi> could make this obſervation and judgment, That Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being commonly more addicted to their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, then their owne dignity and honour, do hold, and account them moſt deere unto them, who do love and embrace <hi>Alexanders,</hi> that is themſelves; then thoſe who do court, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the fortune of Kings. And although there aroſe a diſſention afterwards between him and <hi>Hephaeſtion,</hi> whereby the whole Court was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into parties; <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhewed himſelfe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted and tied to neither party, but chid both; and threatned to puniſh them, if hereafter they put him to the like trouble. In this kind of deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which <hi>Alexander</hi> here uſeth, he manifeſted, not ſo much his equall and indifferent affection towards them both; as a ſingular and moſt eſpecial kind of prudence in Princes, very much to be imitated. This diſcord and difference, he ſees, may produce many troubles; neither was he igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that <hi>Craterus</hi> his wonderfull Authority, with the Macedonians; and his owne favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Hephaeſtion</hi> was envyed, and bred diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt himſelfe: he therefore blames <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaeſtion</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:115933:47"/>for his envy, in publique; and chides <hi>Craterus</hi> privately, leſt the Macedonians ſhould be offended.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Amongſt thoſe, who in the examination of Princely benevolence and favour, have either been more neglective, or being devoid of reaſon have been more unexperienced and unskilfull, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius Primus</hi> deſerves to be liſted, who (preſume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to contend with <hi>Mutianus</hi>) learnt at length, That it was more deſtructive to him that he had diſdained <hi>Mutianus,</hi> then if he had deſpiſed <hi>Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Now, that Princes do more ſharply revenge an injury done to their Miniſters, then to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, is a thing atteſted by Examples almoſt in all Courts, the cauſe whereof <hi>Dio</hi> ſifted out; after he had declared the ſame to have happened in the caſe of <hi>Sejanus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Even as they, (ſaith he) whom virtue and their known merits, have dignified and exalted, do not very much ſtand upon, and eſteem or heed the vanities of their honours, and the outward marks and expreſſions of worſhip and reverence: So on the contrary, they, who by Ambition en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to raiſe themſelves from the ground and duſt, and to cover their domeſtick and covetous briberies, do take it very hainouſly, and interpret it preſently a contempt, if you neglect the leaſt matter or punctillio of homage, or good turne towards them. So much the more difficult is it therefore, to conſerve and hold faſt the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of ſuch, then of the Prince himſelfe. For he counts it his glory to pardon an injury, but they, (that they may not ſeeme to remit, what
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115933:47"/>they cannot vindicate) not onely ſtraine their power in perſecuting their enemies, but oſtentate and boaſt of ſuch their doings.</p>

                     <hi>Pride denoted and obſerved by Examples in men, of the moſt inferiour Ranck and Condition under Princes.

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. ANd not onely hath an inſolent, and haughty carriage and deportment, been deſtructive and miſchievous to Nobles and great ones: but even to men of the moſt inferiour and baſe degree. John king of <hi>Arragon</hi> ſo fondly and fervently loved <hi>Alvarus</hi> de <hi>Luna</hi> (the ſon of a former king of <hi>Arragon,</hi> but borne out of wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke) that he would commit to him the chief affaires, and even the kingly dignity; his Nobles in vaine reſiſting. But when he being lifted up with pride in this proſperous fortune, had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated and thruſt down head-long a Noble man, who in the kings name had admoniſhed him of his duty, himſelfe by the kings Command, loſt his head for his paines.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This hath been in Court, the frequent cauſe of ſuch Ship-wrack; when any hath rendred either himſelfe, or the Prince odious to the people, or to the chief of the nation. For either the Prince
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115933:48"/>himſelfe to free him from envy, will caſt ſuch a one off; or elſe others will rout him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. While <hi>Commodus</hi> was Emperour, <hi>Cleander</hi> had armed the Pretorian Companies againſt the people of Rome. This bred Rome ſo many troubles and tumults, that (had not the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour himſelfe ſacrificed <hi>Cleander</hi> to the peoples fury), he could not have been ſecure.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſame <hi>Commodus</hi> had incurred the odium and hatred of all men, for the love of one <hi>Anterus;</hi> from whom that they might deliver their Maſter, ſome of thoſe Miniſters, who well affected <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus,</hi> met <hi>Anterus</hi> upon a time as he returned from Court; and ſlew him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Eutropius</hi> being (amongſt a few others) a long time beloved of <hi>Arcadius</hi> the Emperour, when he was but believed to be the Author of the ſedition moved by <hi>Tribigildus;</hi> was delivered up by the Prince to his Enemies, as a price of peace and quietneſſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Amongſt thoſe evills, which ſubvert and overthrow Courtiers; that unfaithfulneſs is not to be paſſed by, which bewrayeth the ſecrets of the Prince, and imparts them to his enemy. That of <hi>Sylla,</hi> as it was horrible, ſo was it notorious by the deſtruction of many others, and hammered and forged with many Monſtrous and prodigious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (to wit) with lightneſſe and unconſtancy, imprudence and lacke of heed, vanity and infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; I may add, with a deſire of getting money, unjuſt honour, Revenge, Curioſity, and other reſtleſſe troubles.</p>
               <p n="7">7. As to the ſecret of Princes, I eſteeme it beſt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115933:48"/>that they make choice of ſuch, as are not cleft, and full of chincks and crannyes, ſo as to vent and let out thoſe ſecrets they impart to them; ſeeing they fly onely to them to be admitted into their Conſciences and private thoughts. For if thou alone be knowing; and yet fame and report, which is ingenious and cunning at conjecture and gueſſing, ſhall by chance ſpread abroad ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like that committed to thy ſecrecy; thou wilt not avoid ſuſpition, but he will judge his Secret to iſſue out from thee; And although the Prince (it may be) hath by chance opened the ſame thing to another, yet poſſibly he may forget it; or more confide in the others ſilence and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, and the blame be nevertheleſſe laid on thee.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Not without cauſe was <hi>Philippides</hi> the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick poet (amongſt the chief) deere unto king <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi> who being asked what he would wiſh to be made partaker of, by the Prince; anſwered, That he would refuſe nothing that came from him, ſo long as he might be free from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his ſecrets. Let us follow, as much as may be, his example, and count it ſafer, to be unknowing of his Secret, as a thing hard to be kept, then to be acquainted therewith.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Hiero</hi> Prince of <hi>Syracuſa</hi> ſaid, that they who revealed the ſecrets of Princes were injurious; in that they expoſed others, aſwell as themſelves, to the odium and loathing of the Prince.</p>

               <p n="1">1. BEſides this, moſt doubtfull of all, is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of thoſe, who being driven thereto, either by avarice, or ambition, or by deſire to prop up their own ſecurity, conſpire with a Prince's Enemies, either extraneous and forraigne, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtique.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Cardinal <hi>Balaeus,</hi> the Son of a Botcher, being made Treaſurer by <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11. was alſo from that preferred to a Biſhoprick, from thence by the interceſſion of the King, and the accord of the <hi>Pope</hi> (who indeavoured to confer a Benefite on him whom he had hitherto experienced to be his adverſary) attained to Cardinal Dignity. But afterwards being found to have conſpired with the Kings foes, was impriſoned by the ſpace of 12 years, from whence at length the prayers and interceſſion of <hi>Pope Sixtus</hi> the 4th only, freed him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the like crime, Cardinall <hi>Pratenfis</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, underwent the like puniſhment, who perhaps had never been releaſed from Priſon, but that afterwards drinking his own Urine, he deceived the Phyſitians by diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Strangury.

                     <hi>A Politian may not be the Author of ambiguous Counſels: After what ſort Conſults of underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Warre, and breaking Leagues may be inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted. How great a variety there is of thoſe errors: for which Courtiers fall away from their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and favour with the Prince.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. FIrſt alſo, our Polititian whom we inſtruct, muſt beware, that he be not the Author of ambiguous Counſels; the unhappy iſſue of theſe, will be imputed to the Adviſer, but the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115933:50"/>ſucceſſe, to the fortune and good hap of the Prince, not only by the vulgar who judge of all things by their event; but by the Prince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; who will be glad that he hath one, on whom he may derive the Envy of unhappy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell.</p>
               <p n="2">2. While <hi>Stilico</hi> was living, and after his death, there was but one Argument and ſubject matter of wailing and complaining amongſt the people, to wit, the peace which he had made with the <hi>Goths. Olympius</hi> who had procured the Ruine of <hi>Stilico,</hi> ſtriving to be famous by contrary wayes, broke off the League of peace, <hi>Alaricus</hi> in vain objecting Right and Equity; War being begun, for ſometime contrary to Augury and divination; he being accounted in the judgment of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar the Author of all their Evills, was at length accuſed by the Eunuches, who were very grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous with the Emperour, and leaving the Court fled into <hi>Dalmatia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. When the buſineſſe was of undertaking a Warre or breaking the League, the Miniſters and furtherers in this buſineſſe are made parties; they only bring arguments on both ſides, and leave the choice of either to the arbitrement of the Prince: not with ſtanding, if they were conſtrained to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver their opinions they would conclude it ſafer to incline to peace, unleſs very Neceſſity or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and apparent Utility, perſwaded the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Jovius,</hi> the Succeſſor of <hi>Olympius,</hi> of whom we have ſpoken, wiſely proſecutes the buſineſſe: for he being more prone to War, that ſo he might be more neceſſary to the Prince, did nevertheleſſe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115933:50"/>as the Politick cuſtome of ſome is, prefer the love of Peace. Meeting at <hi>Rhemes</hi> to parly with <hi>Alari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> he ſends thoſe conditions which <hi>Alaricus</hi> had propoſed to <hi>Honorius,</hi> perſwading him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part by other Letters, to offer the command of the Armies to <hi>Alaricus,</hi> by which he might be made more equall and indifferent for other things. The Emperour denying that it was beſides his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe to commit the ſtreſſe thereof to a forrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and one who was yet an Enemy, anſwered that he had rather conſent to became tributary.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Theſe Letters when <hi>Jovius</hi> had read before <hi>Alaricus,</hi> he being wroth, that himſelf, and his, were contemned by <hi>Honorius,</hi> broke off this uncertain web and worke of the Paction and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement: <hi>Jovius</hi> returnes to <hi>Honorius,</hi> who himſelf being offended with the inſolency of his Enemy, ſweares not to have peace with <hi>Alari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> and with the ſame Oath binds all his party. Thus <hi>Jovius</hi> by the ſame ſubtilty and craftineſſe, both removes the envy of the Truce-breakings from himſelf, and obliges <hi>Alaricus</hi> by the teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his good will; whereby he would have had him been made the Tribune of <hi>Caeſars</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; but infolded <hi>Honorius</hi> in War: which thing wonderfully eſtabliſhed the Authority and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Jovius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. There is ſuch great variety in Hiſtories, of thoſe Errors and faults, for which Courtiers fall into disfavour with Princes, that no man by any diligence can ſo collect them all, but that when he hath quoted many, he will yet ſeem to have omitted more. Wherefore the moſt principall only being taſted, we will leave the reſt to every ones induſtry and prudence.</p>

                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By what wiles a Courtier may be ſuppreſſed, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolent perſons: Firſt, That either he may go from Court himſelf, under ſome pretence; or elſe be ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly removed. Of ſuch, who by the ſame Art, are called up out of the Provinces.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE have ſeen how by his own default, a Courtier may fall into the diſpleaſure of a Prince. We will now ſhew the means, by which his foes, ſuch as are envious, or emulous, may depreſſe and abaſe him: For, they may endeavour to remove him from Court, upon ſome pretext not diſhonourable; or may render him ſuſpected or hated to the Prince; or laſtly, in a publick and open manner, conſtrain the Prince to remove him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The way of Amolition, or removing, which we ſaid was the firſt way, hath divers means, and various ends; for ſome, out of a ſhew of honour, or occaſion to live with ſome friends, and neer allies, are induced, not unwillingly, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelves from Court. This way <hi>Stippiota</hi> craftily uſed, (when <hi>Manuel Comnenus</hi> was Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour) to remove <hi>Hagiotheodorita,</hi> who ſtood in his light; for there being a difference between <hi>Michael</hi> the Pedagogue, and <hi>Joſephus Balſamon, Stippiota</hi> perſwaded the Emperour, that if <hi>Hagio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theodorita, Balſamons</hi> kinſman, were made Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> the difference would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115933:51"/>
                  <hi>Hagiotheodorita</hi> being glad of an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to help his kinſman, accepteth the courteſie; little minding, that <hi>Stippiota</hi> alone, would in the interim (his Competitor being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved) have the ordering and managing of the chief affairs of the Empire, which alſo came to paſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some men, being wearied with the contentions &amp; brablings of adverſaries in Court, betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto any Province whatſoever, upon pretext of neceſſary departing thence. Thus did <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who (as <hi>Vellcius</hi> teſtifieth) went into <hi>Aſia,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending ſome principall buſineſſe; but, as report went, for ſome private grudge between him and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> withdrew himſelf from the preſent time.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Tiberius</hi> (while <hi>Caius Caeſar</hi> was yet alive, who envyed him) departed to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> pretending to turn Student there, and (as <hi>Suetonius</hi> ſaith) by his mothers means, obtained, that to cover his reproach, he might make ſhew, as if he had gone Ambaſſadour thither.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If he whom you deſire to remove, have no pretence to get leave to withdraw, and will not take it as a courteſie, that he may depart wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and without compulſion, you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Prince to prefer him, to ſome charge and office, upon this account, that none is more worthy or fit for ſuch an employment.</p>
               <p n="6">6. After the ſame manner do emulous and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious perſons, deſire to have ſuch abſtracted and drawn from a Province, or ſubdued Country, whoſe authority they endeavour to weaken, whom they labour to bring into Court, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115933:52"/>and uſefull to the Prince, and to thruſt him into the croud of Courtiers, by whoſe lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe, he may be the more obſcured and clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This was the artifice and trick, which <hi>Apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> uſed with <hi>Polybius,</hi> when he went about to deprive <hi>Taurio</hi> of the government of <hi>Peloponne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. So <hi>Darius</hi> (by the advice of <hi>Megabyzus</hi>) called back <hi>Hyeſteus</hi> from the government of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> a Region of <hi>Greece;</hi> not becauſe there was need of his preſence, but that he might infringe and leſſen his power and greatneſſe.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If theſe Courtiers were content to enlarge their own place and bounds, by the removing of another, and would ſtop there, the comparing of others far worſe, would render this Art tolerable; but for the moſt part, they ſtick not here.</p>
               <p n="10">10. When <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was Emperour, <hi>Sylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> being Commander of the Infantry, (as <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus Marcellus</hi> reports) by the procurement of <hi>Arbetius,</hi> is ſent into <hi>France,</hi> to correct and amend thoſe miſchiefs, wherewith the Barbarous people had infeſted the French; as one emulous, and that could not endure to ſee any one quiet, and out of trouble; declines ſo great and hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous a work, and turns it upon another. <hi>Sylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> undertaking the journey, and having ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated with the French, became thereby power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Afterwards <hi>Arbetius</hi> compileing envy againſt him, with the Emperour, was at length himſelf brought to ruine.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The ſame fortune almoſt had <hi>Urſicinus,</hi> Commander of the Cavalry, under the ſame
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115933:52"/>Emperour: One <hi>Euſebius</hi> an Eunuch, with many other Courtiers, had conſpired his death; by the machinations and devices of theſe conſpirators, he is ſent into the borders of <hi>Perſia,</hi> that ſo he might be at diſtance from Court, where having continued by the ſpace of ten years, he receives for his ſucceſſor <hi>Sabinianus,</hi> a man, who neither for wit nor experience, was comparable to him, for ſuch a charge. By and by, (a rumour being raiſed, that the Perſians made ready for war) he is commanded to ſtay there, having delivered up his power to the other; <hi>Euſebius</hi> purpoſely ſo diſpoſing the matter, that ſo <hi>Sabinianus</hi> ſhould challenge to himſelf, the proſperous event of the war againſt the Perſians, and that the adverſe and ill fortune thereof might be imputed to <hi>Urſicinus,</hi> which the event afterwards confirmed: For <hi>Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicinus</hi> being dejected for anothers fault, ſpent the remainder of his life in private.

               <p n="12">12. The times of the ſame <hi>Conſtantius</hi> will ſupply us with another example; for <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> the uncle of <hi>Gallus,</hi> by the fathers ſide, being Preſident of the Pretorian bands, was ſent to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the ſedition of the Souldiery, with no other intention, then that he might periſh amongſt the hatefull hands of thoſe mad and pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh people.

               <argument>
                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſecond way, is; Calumnies and Commendations are made uſe of, to make others ſuſpected and hatefull to the Prince. Touching Detraction, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THus much concerning Amolition and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving, as the primary means and way, which is uſed by enemies, and envious and emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous perſons, to bring others into disfavour with their Prince and Soveraigne. The ſecond is, that whereby they render men ſuſpected and odious to the Prince, by the help of detractions and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, or elſe by commendations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In Calumnies we muſt attend unto two things; Firſt, Whether they be fit and ſufficient to change the Prince's will. Secondly, Whether they have a likeneſſe to truth. Of the firſt, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be made, both by the preſent ſtate of affairs, and alſo, by the genius and inclination of the Prince, and the very nature and condition of negotiations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. No calumnies do abound with more ruines of great men, then ſuch as do accuſe and impeach them, of machinations and plots, againſt the Prince, and his rule and government, or of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and diſdaining to obey him, or ſuch as are of detracting ſpeech, and mocking or ſcorning the Prince's words or actions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Calumnies, and falſe accuſations, are then
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115933:53"/>rendred probable and likely, if the accuſation, which makes the party accuſed guilty, be branded with a note of arrogancy, either in the words or actions of themſelves, or elſe of their ſervants, friends, parents, or thoſe who are tied and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to them, by neceſſity or alliance. If they be ſuppoſed to have counterfeited Letters, the judgment and ſentence will be ſuch, as that which the Prince hath already conceived in his mind, even the faithfulneſſe of the calumniator, and the guiltineſſe of the party accuſed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Thoſe things which by calumny are wreſted into a crime, are ſuch, as the party traduced is ſaid to have ſpoken, or done; either ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and of his own accord, or elſe being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the deceits and circumventings of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or envious perſons. Such wits, by allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and enticeing words, can fetch and pump up things that are not; and in every matter, find occaſion and opportunity, wherewith to help themſelves.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There are ſome, who having counſelled and perſwaded a man to do ſomething; when they have found him yield, they make this the very weapon of their accuſation, and feigne, that he hath attempted ſome horrible deſigne againſt the Prince.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A certain Magician a Monk, one <hi>Santaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi> by name, was (before others) beloved by <hi>Baſilius,</hi> Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but envyed beyond meaſure by <hi>Leo</hi> his ſon: And therefore, having endeavoured by all obſequious readineſſe of feigned devotion, to allure his good-will, at length wrought the young man to credulity:
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115933:54"/>For afterwards, (having gotten ſome credit with him) he adviſes <hi>Leo,</hi> to wear a dagger for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, privately, under his Mandilion or Jacket, if at any time he went out to hunting with his father. Following his inſtruction, the Magician goes to his father, and feignes to him, that his ſon had privately conceived parricide, and ſhewes the Dagger, as a detection and token thereof, which he, watching his opportunity, had carried about him. To be brief, the matter was ſo han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, that the ſon was impriſoned; and although protected with the moſt intenſive and vehement prayers and entreaties of the Nobility, he ſcarcely eſcaped puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In the time of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour, <hi>Aetius</hi> accuſeth <hi>Boniface</hi> his companion, (who was very deer to the Emperour, and made Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Africa</hi>) of treachery againſt <hi>Placidia,</hi> the Prince's mother, and that he intended to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>Africa</hi> to himſelf; adviſing alſo, that he might be ſpeedily recalled thence. At the ſame time, he admoniſheth <hi>Boniface</hi> by Letters, that he was accuſed at Court, and upon that account recalled; but bade him yet take heed of comming back, leſt he ſhould be an enemy to his own ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Boniface</hi> giving credit to theſe things, ſo far diſobeyed the Empereſſes recalling him, that ſhe agreed with <hi>Gontarus,</hi> King of the <hi>Validuli,</hi> and <hi>Genſericus</hi> his ſon, then manageing the affairs in <hi>Spain,</hi> to reduce him, if he oppoſed by force; who by this occaſion, poſſeſſed themſelves of <hi>Mauritania.</hi> At length, the cheat being diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Placidia</hi> permitted, that after the cuſtom of that age, a Duell ſhould be appointed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115933:54"/>
                  <hi>Aetius</hi> being conquered, he was commanded to avoid the Court.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Not unlike to this was the ſubtilty and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of <hi>Samonas,</hi> who being deerly beloved to <hi>Leo</hi> the ſon of <hi>Baſilius</hi> the Emperour; for detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Conſpiracy of one <hi>Baſilius</hi> a kinſman of <hi>Zoa</hi> the Empreſſe, who would have deſtroyed <hi>Andronicus</hi> being choſen Chieftaine, together with <hi>Amerinus Logotheta</hi> againſt the <hi>Saracens;</hi> he wills his friends to admoniſh him by Letters, that he ſhould beware of <hi>Hymerius;</hi> who came with an intention to accuſe him (exoculation, and depriving of the ſight, was a ſort of puniſhment in that age, wherewith principall men, and thoſe whoſe power they thought fit to abate and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, were afflicted and chaſtiſed) <hi>An ronicus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveing theſe things to be of truth, which were but feigned by <hi>Samonas;</hi> having made his eſcape from <hi>Hymerius,</hi> poſſeſſeth himſelfe of a certaine Caſtell. This hindered not <hi>Samonas</hi> to exaggerate and heape up buſineſſe againſt him to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and by his perſwaſions, an army is ſent, which drives <hi>Andronicus</hi> together with the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens</hi> from the confines of the Empire.</p>
               <p n="10">10. We have a little before (Chap. 27. <hi>Numb</hi> 10) made mention of <hi>Arbetius.</hi> It ſeemes worth obſervation how he ſuperaddeth Treachery upon treachery. When he ſees that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with <hi>Silvanus,</hi> and doubted leaſt he coming to Rome, ſhould obliterate and wipe off the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations objected againſt him, he takes care that the Emperours Letters (by which he calls <hi>Silvanus</hi> unto him) might be committed to the charge of one <hi>Apodemius.</hi> He coming into France, and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115933:55"/>ſuppreſſing the Letters, tells him that he was in very imminent danger. Here upon <hi>Silvanus</hi> moving ſedition as a remedy and cure of his owne ſafety, imprudently and unawares verified the Calumin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But truly we have too long been ſilent concerning <hi>Sejanus;</hi> who, as he was wonderfully crafty in all things, ſo was he not unaccuſtomed to this Art whereof we now treate. That he might render <hi>Agrippina</hi> the more ſuſpected to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> he ſuborneth his friends, that they might puff up and increaſe her hopes beyond what was lawfull. Her neighbours alſo are provoked and inticed, to ſtimulate and prick forward the haughty and ſmelling ſpirits of <hi>Agrippina,</hi> by depraved and ſtubborne words and ſpeeches. Himſelfe being the Engineere and contriver of the plot, <hi>Claudia Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chra</hi> Neice to <hi>Agrippina</hi> is accuſed and ſlandered; to the end that <hi>Agrippina</hi> complaining hereof, and being a woman, hot and fell, ill able to beare a diſcontentment, might the more vehemently and ſharply touch and gaule the ſuſpicious mind of the Emperour.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Sejanus,</hi> not herewith ſatisfied, ſtrikes higher and harder at the diſcontented and improvident Lady: and having ſuborned ſome, who in ſhew of friendſhip ſhould admoniſh her, that there was an intent to poyſon her; and that therefore, ſhe ſhould ſhun to eate of the Banquet which <hi>Tiberius,</hi> her father in law had invited her to; She (unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily credulous and raſh of beliefe), when <hi>Tiberius</hi> offered her an Apple, withdrew her hand, and thereby very much offended him.</p>
               <p n="13">13. He alſo, (when there was appointed unto
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:115933:55"/>
                  <hi>Agrippina</hi> and her ſons a Scout-ſouldier to lye perdue, and to watch and obſerve their actions), inſtructed and ſuborned ſome to admoniſh her; that ſhe ſhould fly to the Armyes of <hi>Germany;</hi> or elſe lay hold on the effigies and pourtraiture of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> in the moſt frequented place of judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and alſo ſhould invoke the aide and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Senate and people of Rome.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Moreover, by what kind of wickedneſſe he alſo circumvented his Client <hi>Titius Sabinus,</hi> that he might render him altogether ſuſpected of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to <hi>Tiberius;</hi> is to be read in the very His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. Which being no leſſe abominable, then worthy your remembrance; t'will not be irkſome to thee Reader, that we have here run it over, in the very words of the worthy Hiſtorian, which are extant in the fourth Book of his Annals.</p>

               <p>I Cannot but add one Example more out of the ſame <hi>Cornelius Tacitus.

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>VVE have ſaid before, that the affection of the Prince towards the Calumniator, makes very much to confirme and ſtrengthen the Calumny. This was throughly noted in <hi>Seja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:115933:57"/>who endeavouring to bring <hi>Agrippina</hi> the widow of <hi>Germanicus</hi> under ſuſpition with <hi>Livia Auguſta,</hi> choſe <hi>Julius Poſthumus</hi> for his turne: for he, by the Adultery and forgery of <hi>Mutilia Priſca,</hi> was one of <hi>Livias</hi> intimate ones, and very fit for <hi>Sejanus</hi> his Counſels, but <hi>Priſca</hi> was very great in the opinion of <hi>Auguſta.</hi> They are the words of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> in his fourth book.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But the ſnares and guiles of Calumnies have a more compendious, and ſhort procedure and determination, if the party ſlandered have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been any whit ſuſpected by the Prince. For then the Calumniator, may not onely thereby ſuppreſſe the other, but advance himſelfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The familiars and friends of <hi>Aulus Vitellius,</hi> would not ſet upon <hi>Junius Bleſus,</hi> before ſuch time as they perceived <hi>Vitellius</hi> his benevolence and friendſhip towards him, begin to waxe ſtale; and do the ſooner obtain their deſire, becauſe <hi>Vitellius</hi> his brother <hi>Lucius</hi> accommodates them with his aid in the accuſation. <hi>Hiſt.</hi> Book the third.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Gracchus,</hi> one of the Children of <hi>Caſar,</hi> and, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith in the 13th of his <hi>Annals,</hi> by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and Age having been taught in the Princes family, even from the time of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> thought, that the beſt way, and remedy for him to conſerve and keep the favour of the Prince, was, to accuſe <hi>Cornelius Sylla,</hi> whom <hi>Nero</hi> had a good while before ſuſpected. The like Art <hi>Tigel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> uſeth againſt the ſame <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Plautus.</hi> Whereof <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the 14th of his Annals ſaith thus. <hi>Tigellinus</hi> groweth dayly more ſtrong, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth

And having found that <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Sylla</hi> were much dreaded, <hi>Plautus</hi> having been lately remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into <hi>Aſia. Sylla</hi> into <hi>Gallia Narbonenſis,</hi> makes mention of, and commemorates their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and neer Allies, the one of the <hi>Eaſterne</hi> the other of the <hi>Germane</hi> Army. After a few other paſſages he turnes quite about, and beſpeaks <hi>Sylla</hi> a needy indigent fellow, and by that means nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly adventurous and ſaucy, and a Counterfeiter of ſloath and negligence, while he may find a place for temerity and raſhneſſe. <hi>Plautus</hi> by reaſon of his great wealth was unfeignedly deſirous of eaſe and idleneſſe.</p>

                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Art of Calumniators and the chiefe meanes of detracting; To accuſe one of a ſpeech which in it ſelf is true but fould, and not ſpoken by the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and by a ſhew of relating the words of others, to reprove the evill actions of the Prince without puniſhment or danger.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THey who accuſe another to have ſpoken e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill of the Prince, by how much they draw and heap up more evill words from thoſe which are true, by ſo much the eaſie wil their accuſations find credit and belief.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This evidently appeares in the example of <hi>Granius Marcellus</hi> whom (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith in the 1 book of his <hi>Annals</hi>) <hi>Caepio Crispinus</hi> accuſed to have uttered ſome ſiniſter and unhappy words touching <hi>Tiberius,</hi> a crime inevitable, ſith that the accuſer chooſeth ſomething of the Prince's vicious actions, and objecteth them to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed's charge to have ſpoken of. For becauſe they were true, therefore were they believed to have been ſpoken by him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Many Calumniators having followed this Example have upbraided and twitted the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours with their faults, by a ſhew of relating other mens ſpeches, without reproof. This alone, in a manner moved them, to be very ſparing in giving ear to falſe accuſers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And truly <hi>Tiberius,</hi> as he was a hater of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115933:59"/>ſo was he a lover of calumnies and accuſations; and leſt he ſhould hear the one, when he was preſent in the Senate, and that the other might not be omitted, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to <hi>Caprea,</hi> believing (as the Hiſtorian ſaith) it was fit for him to ſhun the aſſembly of his Councills, and their votes, which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, while he was preſent with them, were grave and weighty. <hi>Annal. Book</hi> 4.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This way of upbraiding Princes, with their vicious actions, did they uſe, who tranſlating by checks and taunts the Matricide of <hi>Nero,</hi> accuſe others of the ſame crime, before <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who was the auth or thereof, with a deſire rather of rebuke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſcommending the wickedneſſe, then of deſtroying the party accuſed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Theſe are the moſt uſuall wayes and modes which calumniators uſe; for who can enumerate them all? Calumny is a Monſter, which hath a thouſand figures and ſhapes, a thouſand crafts and cunning deceits.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Of the wiles and ſubtleties of Court-commendations, masked Courtiers, and ſuch as diſguiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The inward intention and diſpoſition of ſuch, as commend or diſpraiſe us, is to be looked into. The third way and means, by which one Courtier oppreſſeth and grieveth another,</hi> viz. <hi>Power and Force.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>FRom Calumnies, let us come to Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations; there is uſe made likewiſe of theſe in Courts, (as we have ſaid) to ſuppreſſe and pul down others; the moſt here do palliate and cloak their odium, envy, and emulation, that ſo they may the more eaſily deceive and fruſtrate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thus did <hi>Fabius Valens</hi> ſcandalize <hi>Mantius Valens,</hi> by ſecret criminations, without his knowledge or miſtruſt; and that he might be the leſſe aware of his deceits, would openly commend him. <hi>Tacitus Hiſt.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. So did <hi>Euſebius</hi> the Eunuch, impugne and overcome <hi>Urſicinus,</hi> by the inticeing allurements of immenſe and huge bounty and largeſſe, and did often openly call him, a ſtout and valiant man; being very crafty and cunning, to intangle and inſnare the ſimple man, in his poyſonous and deathfull intrapments; and in that ſeaſon too powerful, as <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> reports.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Alfonſus</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> when a certain perſon had before him commended another,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115933:60"/>(beſides his accuſtomed wont and manner) tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about to his friend, <hi>Iſte exitium haud dubiè ei, quem laudat, meditatur,</hi> That man doubtleſſe means ruine to him, whom he thus commendeth. Nor was the King miſtaken in this opinion; for about fix months after, he that ſo highly had commended, impleads and ſues the other at Law, and had overthrown him, had not the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceded.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Mucianus,</hi> when he could not oppreſſe <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi> the firſt, openly loadeth him with much commendations in the Senate, and ſecret promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; ſhewing and boaſting, that the nigher <hi>Spain</hi> was vacant, by the departure of <hi>Cluvius Rufus;</hi> and beſtowes upon his friends Tribuneſhips and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: And after he had puſt up his mind with hope and deſire, remitteth and weakeneth his force and ſtrength, by diſmiſſing the ſeventh Legion in their winter-quarters, whoſe love to <hi>Antonius</hi> was moſt ardent. <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the 4th. Book of his Hiſtories.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Neither do Courtiers onely, but even Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when they deſire to diminiſh and pull down ſome, take this way and road. <hi>Tiberius</hi> (having <hi>Libo</hi> under ſecret ſuſpect and envy) advanceth him to the Pretorſhip, and feaſteth him often, not being eſtranged in countenance, not moved in language, and ſo conceals his anger, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith, in the ſecond Book of his Annalls. By the ſame Art, he alſo overthrew <hi>Sejanus. Domitian</hi> was never more to be feared, then when in his countenance he made ſhew of courteſie. <hi>Nicetas</hi> was wont to call the commendations of <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,</hi> the beginnings of an injury; his liberality,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115933:60"/>a token of confiſcation of goods; his lenity, the forerunner of death.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Some, in commending others, have this reach, that thereby they may kindle the Prince's hate againſt them. By this means, was <hi>Julius A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricola</hi> ſuppreſſed by <hi>Domitian;</hi> whereupon, <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> writing of <hi>Agricola,</hi> ſaith thus; The cauſe of his danger, was not any crime or complaint of hurting any body, but the Prince's being diſpleaſed at his vertues, and the glory of the man, and withall (that worſt ſort of friends) ſuch as commend and applaud.</p>

                     </gap>ian</hi> the Emperour had a ſaying, <hi>Nullos eſſe capitaliores hoſtes quàm larvatos Aulicos:</hi> There are none more capital and deadly enemies, then masked and vizarded Courtiers, ſuch as <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybius,</hi> and, after him, <hi>Mamertinus</hi> deſcribes; who, in a Panegyrick, and flattering ſpeech, ſpeaks thus: <hi>Callido artificio accuſatoriam dicacitatem lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum titulis peragebant in omnibus conventiculis, quaſi per benevolentiam:</hi> They rehearſed accuſato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſcoffings and reproaches, by a cunning Art, under the titles of commendations, in all their conventicles, and private meetings, as done out of good will.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But we may then diſcover thoſe commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations to be uſurped by ſome, when in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending one, they endeavour to bewray and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note another, as unlike to him. This kind of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, <hi>Plutarch</hi> objects to <hi>Herodotus,</hi> when he ſaies, that the Athenians were commended by him, as valiantly retunding and repreſſing the Perſians Armies; not with a deſire to extoll the Athenians, but to diſgrace and defame the others.</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:115933:61"/>10. It is uſuall with Kings, as <hi>Seneca</hi> teſtifieth, to commend their miniſters and ſervants, who are deceaſed, that ſo they may ſhame ſuch as are living. Thus did <hi>Auguſtus</hi> advance and ſet forth, the faithfull duty and ſervices of <hi>Mecoenas</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> when having openly manifeſted the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualities of their daughters, he would reprehend his familiars and friends, as careleſſe and negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of their Prince's buſineſſe and fame.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> beats <hi>Tiberius</hi> black and blew, by commending and excuſing him; whereof <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> writing in the firſt Book of his Annals, ſaith thus, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> a few years before, had required of the State and Councill, that <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſhould have the power of a Tribune, although in an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Oration, he had yet caſt out ſomething, touching his habit and attire, and his inſtitutions and purpoſes; all which, as ſeeming to excuſe, he upbraids and caſts in his teeth.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Theſe things therefore ſhould admoniſh us, that we endeavour to look into the inward intents, and diſpoſitions of ſuch, as either praiſe or reproach us.</p>
               <p n="13">13. We told you, that the laſt way and means, by which Courtiers are oppreſſed by their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, is, Force and Strength, which then prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally takes place, when either People or Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, being offended at our dignity or manners, ſtir up ſedition.</p>
               <p n="14">14. 'Tis not unknown, what tumults were amongſt the Pariſians, how they were heated therewith, when <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> was taken priſoner. Nor is the condition and fortune of thoſe unknown, who, when his ſon was Vice-Roy,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115933:61"/>held the principall offices and dignities in the Kingdome.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Not many years ſince, the ſeditions of the Janizaries, ſwept away Miniſters of chief autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, from the Turkiſh Emperours. The times of <hi>Arcaaius</hi> the Emperour, will afford us ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples hereof, from the moſt antient Hiſtories. <hi>Ruffinus</hi> was very neer and deer (amongſt the chiefeſt) to that Prince, who being offended with <hi>Stilico,</hi> and meditating his ruine and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſends <hi>Gaina</hi> with the Armies, as an Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Emperour; but, in very deed, to take away the life of <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> which alſo was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed: For <hi>Ruffinus</hi> being gone forth with the Armie, the Souldiers of <hi>Gaina</hi> having riſen up, by giving a ſignall, compaſſed him about, and tore him in pieces. <hi>Eutropius</hi> being ſubſtituted in place of <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> had likewiſe offended ſome prime Courtiers; and (the ſame <hi>Gaina</hi> being the plotter and contriver) <hi>Tribigildus</hi> moves ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; who flying over, and diſpoyling <hi>Aſia,</hi> denies peace upon any other tearms or advantage, then, that <hi>Eutropius</hi> ſhould be taken away: To which Law, at length (<hi>Gaina</hi> driving the Chariot) the Emperour conſenteth.

                        </gap>ſpoſition of the Prince, envying ſuch as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, is amongſt the cauſes, why the Courtier is disfavoured and diſ-eſteemed by him. How ſuch diſpleaſure is to be handled and ordered.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>VEry often, Courtiers, who think themſelves guarded on all hands, happen upon a Prince, whoſe Genius is vain, diſtruſtfull, envious, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, cruell, or timidous, which proves to their inevitable ruine. Theſe diſeaſes, as planted in Nature, do moſtly what delude the circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the moſt prudent. <hi>Seneca,</hi> owing much to his liberty with <hi>Nero,</hi> but little to his ſervice, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though prudent, and not uncrafty in Courtly Arts; yet being overcome, as it were, by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the Prince's genius and diſpoſition, yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at laſt. He firſt incurs his envy by his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and wealth; and afterwards falling under calumny and falſe accuſations, was bereft of the Prince's favour, and his own life together.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The diffidence and envy of Princes, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſome, hath been ſo formidable, that they had rather ſuffer a diminution and abatement of their own emoluments, and profits, then be highly active, with their Prince's envy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:115933:62"/>3. <hi>Publius Venidius,</hi> fearing the Envy of <hi>Marc Antony,</hi> (by whoſe Authority he waged warr;) was content to have repelled the <hi>Parthians</hi> in three ſeverall battells even to <hi>Media,</hi> yet would not proſecute the victory.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſame thing did <hi>Belliſarius,</hi> when <hi>Juſtinian</hi> was Emperour, as <hi>Agathias</hi> ſayes; when in like manner he feared, leaſt the greatneſſe of the victory, and applauſe of the people, ſhould ſtirre up the hatred of the Nobles and afterwards of the Prince.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Such as theſe, neither provide rightly for the utility and advantage of the Prince; nor their owne honours. But the fault nevertheleſſe is not in them ſo much, as in him that rules; and for this cauſe <hi>Mertoenas</hi> perſwades <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> that he ſhould neither impute ſiniſter Events to his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, nor ſucceſſefull to Himſelfe. For (ſaies he) many of thoſe who handle publique affaires, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be envyed by the Prince, have more neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently acted in their Imployment; chuſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to run the hazard of Glory, then ſafety.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Their courſe notwithſtanding, ſeems beſt in my approbation; who, to avoid Envy, whatſoever notable Enterprize they publiſh and ſet forth, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the glory thereof to the Prince, though abſent at the time of the action.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Agrippa</hi> the ſon in law of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth thoſe who take in hand great matters, to attribute the thing accompliſhed to the Prince; and himſelfe did often ſo. Thus <hi>Joab</hi> when he had beſiged <hi>Rabbath</hi> and could have ſubdued it, would not before <hi>David</hi> himſelfe was come; <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erus</hi> when the warr was to be compoſed, with
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115933:63"/>
                  <hi>Artacona;</hi> waited for the preſence of <hi>Alexander. Julius Agricola,</hi> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> reports, never trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed for any Actions to his owne fame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne, but referred the fortune to the Author, and Generall, looking on himſelfe, but as a Miniſter and inſtrument.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This ſame Envy and Emulation, (for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers though divers are heere the like in effect;) let it be that they are diſeaſes, yet have they been common and familiar to the moſt generous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; ſuch as were <hi>Philip,</hi> and <hi>Alexander;</hi> and do more ſtrongly blaſt ſome, then others.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the ſecond of that name, had dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated and appointed the care of thoſe Seas, which flowed up to Conſtantinople, to <hi>Syrus</hi> to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured and walled in; which worke when he had effected in ſixty dayes, this Celerity and ſpeedy diſpatch was ſo gratefull to the people; that they cryed out on all ſides, that the City was built by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> but renewed by <hi>Cyrus.</hi> This being heard of the Emperour, ſtirr'd up ſuch Envy in him, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> to expiate it, was neceſſitated to put on the hood.</p>
               <p n="10">10. He that hath to do with ſuch diſpoſitions, may think that he walkes upon the hot imbers; and therefore ought with all diligence ſo to act, as that he may diligently ſearch out their incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; that ſo he may guard himſelfe againſt them, or if that may not be done; he may at leaſt be conſcious to himſelfe, of having not omitted his duty and office.</p>

               <argument>
                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of obtaining favour with, and retaining an office under the Prince's ſucceſſour. The kinds of Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niatours that hinder us in this place. The dexterity and quickneſſe of ſtopping and reſtraining them. A true friend in Court, is</hi> Rara avis <hi>ſeldome found.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. HE may worthily be reckoned amongſt the happy ones, and as it were the Chickens of fortune; whoſe Authority with the Prince from whom he had his beginning, remaines in the ſame height and loftineſſe with his Succeſſor. This is rare in Courts, becauſe he who preſumeth to be next; by retaining his office, is for the moſt part ſuſpected to thoſe that rule; and being ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in this place, they are very often neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to croſſe and thwart ſuch perſons which yeelds moſt frequent ſeed to deadly feuds and hatred.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And beſides this, the ſucceſſor of a Prince hath moſtly his owne Miniſters and Servants, well known to him by their long and faithfull ſervice and imployments, to whom that they may make way to dignities and honours, he will pull down the Clients and retainers of the deceaſed, either freely or by perſwaſion to give place to others, that are petitioners.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are yet ſome, whom either the matter of their imployments for which they are apter then others, their office whatever it be inſinuateth them onto the ſucceeding Prince's acceptance, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115933:64"/>the deceaſed Prince he would not part with any ſuch a one.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Macro</hi> to ingratiate himſelfe with <hi>Caligula</hi> ſubornes and incenſeth his wiſe, <hi>Ennia,</hi> to entiſe the young man by love, and to contract matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony with him, that ſo ſhe might overcome him and prevaile with him. The ſame <hi>Macro</hi> cauſeth <hi>Tiberius</hi> when he lay dying, to be oppreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and overcharged, with the weight of heavy Clothes caſt upon him, as ſayeth <hi>Tacitus</hi> in his ſixth Book. <hi>Julian</hi> the Emperour retaines <hi>Arbetio</hi> by him, although he hated him for his pride, and for his contentious and turbulent ſpirit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him to be neceſſary to him. Afterwards <hi>Valentinian</hi> calls the ſame <hi>Arbetio</hi> to Court of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that he might oppoſe and ſet himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Procopius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. We have ſhewne hitherto, what a Courtier is to ſhun and avoid, who would enjoy the grace and favour of his Prince. The head and chief of all Counſells, which can in this place be given a Courtier, is, Modeſty towards the Prince; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring himſelfe not in himſelfe, nor comparing himſelfe with himſelfe; not framing himſelf I ſay, by the Modul of fortune, but of his own duty, acting nothing boaſtingly and in a bravadoe, noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing irreverently, avoyding Envy (as much as is poſſible). A thing ſo formidable to many worthies and ancient Grandees; that many (pretending un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitneſſe, or other inability to mannage them); others (betaking themſelves to their books,) have with drawne and eſtranged themſelves from the publique Negotiations, as one, whereof His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians make mention, of <hi>Domitian;</hi> as the other, of <hi>Galba.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:115933:64"/>6. Firſt we will carefully tranſmit, and paſſe over thoſe Commendations of Malevolent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and the Calumnies; of which we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſpoken.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They who ſlander us, or ſay, that there is wanting in us ſome of thoſe things which are requiſite to the well ſerving of a Prince; and affirme that we have ſpoken ſomething amiſſe, and with intention to offend; or elſe have by Act, hurt and injured ſome body.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The fault which is objected againſt us, is either to be excuſed, or amended; or elſe expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and purged by the operation of other vertues. As alſo all our words and deeds are ſo to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated, that they become not obnoxious to Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter interpretations and conſtructions. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the mind of another, is firſt to be ſcrued and ſearched into; before we diſcloſe our owne. But if through careleſneſſe, ſomewhat may fall from us, that may be offenſive, we muſt ſhew, and evidence to them; (either by ſome good office to be performed for them, or by caſting in ſome ſmooth and handſome interpretation, by other words and ſpeeches), that we had no mind to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them in our diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If we have cognizance that we are calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninated, it will be adviſedly and wiſely done of us; to be as little abſent, and at diſtance from the party, to whom we are accuſed, as poſſible may be. For beſides this, that affection towards ſuch as are abſent freezeth in time; the reproach and ſlander, unleſſe maturely and timouſly repelled, and foiled by the aide of verity and truth, will more eaſily find place; which (the courſe being
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115933:65"/>turned, and a doubt ſpeedily injected), will flagg and wither: but by delay, and none contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the accuſer's affirmations, will be corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and ſtrengthned, and take roote in the Prince's mind, and carry him ſo ſarre; as that he may hate the party accuſed, before he inquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Crime.</p>
               <p n="10">10. He therefore that will be rightly adviſed herein, ſhall procure himſelfe one, or more friends; who in his abſence may defend him from the aſſaults of Slander: but be ſure they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of honour; and ſuch, as to whoſe defence the Prince may no leſſe give eare, then to the others Calumnies. But of ſuch friends, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe there is great ſterility and barrenneſſe at Court: where it is moſtly uſuall amongſt all, either to oppreſſe their fellowes; or ſuffer them to be oppreſſed. Yet it happens ſometimes that there may be one, who by benefits received from us; or by deſire to oblige us to them; or laſtly out of hate to the Accuſer; may be moved and perſwaded to ſuch a good turne.</p>

                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How much Oſtentation is to be avoided by a Courtier in favour with the Prince. What Retinew he may have. Of Courtly modeſty &amp; moderation. The reaſon and proportion of Clients and Retainers, and of friends.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>A Courtier ſhould not only ſuch Oſtentation and boaſting of his Prince's favour, that ſo he may avoid the Envy of Compeers and equalls (of which we have ſpoken <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.) but that of the Prince alſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When on a time the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nobility in the Raign of <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, went about to root out and overthrow Cardinall <hi>Spinoſa,</hi> ſee how they go about to undermine him: they all lay down their Maſes and Offices at his foot, they all feigne and profeſs that he is the Hinge upon which their fortunes depend. The Prince's domeſtick Miniſters and ſervants offer themſelves ready at his beck. When the King gets intelligence hereof he is removed from Court; and within two years decayes, what ever the loftie ſtructure of power were, that he had built to himſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let a Courtier therefore learn to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with a ſmall retinue and train, to keep his ſtation, and ſubſiſt with that dignity wherewith the Prince hath adorned him, and rather below his degree; but let him never tranſgreſſe his bounds. Its unſeaſonable to diminiſh and curtaile ones
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115933:66"/>train onely in a declining Fortune. 'Twas no boot to <hi>Seneca</hi> after he had left <hi>Neroe's</hi> favour to betake himſelf to a private Cottage, and to have compoſed and built up to himſelf a Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid of ſtudies, and under pretende of unhealthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to deny entrance to viſitors; nor did it any thing eaſe the mind of <hi>Agricola,</hi> by night, and with ſlender attendance, to walke about the City.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It behoveth very much that a man do ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly compoſe and module himſelf to tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and moderation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Yet although we would not have you be ſurround with the noiſe and rout of many ſuitors &amp; attenders; nevertheleſs would we not have you neglect to make many your Clients and retainers: not ſuch as ſhould ſerve for your pomp and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity; but ſuch, as, if any dyſaſter ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall thee, may either reſtore and renew, or at leaſt refreſh and comfort thee.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For though ſiniſter and unhappy Fortune hath found but few ſuch friends, yet hath it moſt found ſome, who if they cannot eye friendſhip yet may they for their own benefit and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, have reſpect to ſomthing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Comforts in adverſe fortune. The benefits of Princes are to be diſpenſed warily: His favour is not to be too much divided amongſt others. By what means one may intercede for others. Favour is not ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to be boaſted of. The free arbitrement of Princes in acting. What commands of his are to be obeyed &amp; diſpatched. The reaſon of a Princes dreſſe and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuouſneſſe. How we are to deale with one that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains to us of being offended and hurt by the Prince. Of the Court houſhold ſervice. What is the moſt eſpeciall part and Office of Courtly wiſdome.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt yet, as it is a great Comfort and conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in adverſe fortune, to have communicated with others in our proſperity, and to have uſed the favour of the Prince to lift up and advance others: ſo is a Courtier alſo to be admoniſhed that he diſpenſe and beſtow thoſe benefits wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For it is moſt certain, that whatever the Prince hath conferred on another at our requeſt is in a great meaſure to be imputed to us. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his grace and favour, unleſſe it be very great towards us, is not to be too much divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others; and very ſeldome are others who are not after ſome ſort knowne to the prince, to be recomended unto him. That of <hi>Horace</hi> is to be obſerved.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:115933:67"/>

                     <hi>Qualem commendes, etiam atque etiam adſpice; ne mox</hi>

                  <l>Leſt by their faults thy ſelf ſhould get diſgrace;</l>
                  <l>By their reproof a bluſh light on thy face.</l>
               </q>
               <p n="2">2. If we deſire to beg a Boon of the Prince let our requeſt be juſt, and accommodated and fitted to time; conjoyned likewiſe with the dignity and Emolument and advantage of the Prince, and ſuch as the like hath been obtained by many others. If the Prince ſignifieth his conſent, let us manifeſtly evidence that we accept it as a very great benefit and bounty; if he refuſe, we muſt be very carefull, that we give him not cauſe to think that we are diſcontented.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Here alſo muſt we obſerve that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Chap.</hi> 35. <hi>Num.</hi> 1. we admoniſhed, that we do not ambitiouſly oſtentate and boaſt of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces favour, as if we had him obnoxious to our Commands, which ſome having done have ill ſucceeded as we ſhewed. What ever Princes act, they deſire to ſeem to act it, by their own free Arbitrement and will, without the addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and props, or Authority of others, eſpecially of their ſubjects.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the Prince give us in Command any thing hard and perilous, lets endeavour to have it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115933:67"/>in writing, and if poſſible to be moſt accurately and exquiſitely gathered and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; if any difficulties occur in executing them, let us ripen them, and before we betake us to the Province and place appoynted to execute them in, let us not omit or neglect to unfold and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare them, if the matters be not fit to be written and be to be committed to us in ſecret, we are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to iterate and repeat them over in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, that we may more throughly underſtand the mind of the Commander, and he may ſee, that his Authority in the things which we act, is not denyed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That which remains, is, We ought to ſhew our promptitude and readineſſe to do, even the meaneſt offices the Prince Commands us to. A ſmall matter ofttimes opens a way to a great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; and Princes will have their Commands to be eſtimated, not by the weight and ponderoſity of the things commanded, but by the magnitude and greatneſſe of their own fortune: and therefore are not leſſe offended at our abandoning and diſdaining of their leſſe and eaſie Commands, than of the hardſhips and hazards they expoſe us to, by their imployment.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When we are neer the Prince, we ought aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duouſly to watch that we be not overrun with ſuddain and unexpected commands, or taken tardy in doing ſomething beſides our buſineſſe and imployment. To this purpoſe, let us (as much as may be) obſerve and preoccupate in our mind, the things which are incumbent on us, and prepare our thoughts to every thing which falls into agitation, and that we ſpeak not many things
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115933:68"/>to the Prince, nor any thing that we do not well know and underſtand. When the Prince ſpeaks, let us be intent, and not minding other matters, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let us appear ſad, and full of thoughts, leſt we ſeem, either not to hear, or by a careleſſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to tranſmit and paſſe over ſlightly his ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If any one that is grieved by the Prince ſhall come to us and complain of his fortune; let us ſhew, that we pitty his caſe, and perſwade him to ſilence and patience: let us alſo raiſe him up to hope well, extenuating the Injury done to him, and excuſing the Prince. But we muſt act very circumſpectly with ſuch; for there are ſome who feigne themſelves injured, that ſo they may pump and draw up ſomething from us, which may ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a ſiniſter and evill will in us, towards the Prince, and may thereby find occaſion to oppreſs us. Others are <hi>(re vera)</hi> and in truth grieved and hurt, yet oftentimes being imprudent and ſilly, and carried away by affection and ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, do not conceale thoſe things which are communicated to them in ſecret truſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If it be our fortune to have the charge of a family, we ought to keep our ſervants alſo from ſpeaking more freely againſt the Prince, or ſuch as are by affection and love chiefly endeered to him; for the fault of a houſhold ſervant is of times tranferred upon the Maſter.</p>
               <p n="9">9.

                  <p>
                     <hi>A judgment touching the Conſtancy and mutations and changes of Princely love and Benevolence. Felicity inexplicable and intricate; The Court ſtarr.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THat a Courtier may rightly judge of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and permanency of the Prince's good will, towards him, it is not enough that he be knowing of the Princes Genius and diſpoſition, and the Authority and power both of his friends and foes; he ought firſt throughly to weigh and conſider the cauſe, which exkindled this love of the Prince towards him. For if that which was the cauſe ſhould ceaſe in us, or be found more valid and ſtrong in another; doubtleſſe the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces affection towards us, will altogether cool; or at leaſt be leſſened.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It's ſometimes difficult to divine, what the cauſe is for which thou art beloved; and as <hi>Auſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> ſayes, This is a felicity, the reaſon whereof we cannot render. But ordinarily, this love of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ariſeth, either from a ſimilitude and likeneſs
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115933:69"/>of diſpoſition; or from the grace and comelineſſe of our deportment and behaviour, or from ſome duty and offices performed; or ſome other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and aptitude to obey their will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That love, which that externall and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grace and likeneſſe of manners produceth; although it ſeeme moſt firme and ſtable, doth ſooneſt of all wax old and decay; both becauſe as we have ſaid, the Genius and inclinations of men is changed according to age, and the variety and change of intervening and accidentall affaires; and alſo for that it is a rare thing for two ſuch like diſpoſitions to be found, which may not in ſome thing differ and diſagree. Oftimes alſo, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thing which they have, is more prevalent to diſcord and diviſion, then the things wherein they reſemble each other, are to Concord and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Notwithſtanding, I know not what ſtarre or conſtellation, by an unuſuall manner and way, doth ſo attemperate and ſeaſon ſome men to the Prince; that he can not eaſily in any thing depart from, nor leave ſuch a ones faſhions and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature. And theſe are they, (I deny not) who reape a plentifull crop of good things before all others; eſpecially if they know how, wittily and trimly to ſerve the time; and before a Tempeſt to furl up their ſailes.</p>

               <argument>
                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The love of Princes towards women. The paramours of Princes. Preſents beſtowed on Princes, are eaſily envyed. The condition of well deſerving men in Court. The affections of ſome Princes towards ſuch men. The reaſon why Rewards and Largeſſes are given and appointed for the undertaking of buſineſs. the love of Princes towards ſuch as miniſter to their volupties and delights.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>WIth this kind of love, Princes are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times affected to Women; and that by ſo much the more, as they are prone to venerious volupties and pleaſures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the ſame nevertheleſſe do theſe fall away and decline; if not by their owne fault, yet at leaſt by the ſatiety of the party loving, or by the ſight of a better Love or Miſtreſſe: whereby it cometh to paſſe, that they become more crafty and guilefull; who endeavour to divert the Prince from all familiarity and converſe with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, eſpecially with ſuch, who ſeem fit and able to bend the Prince's mind another way. Some by feigned and counterfit diſdaine, have kept them loving and kind to them. Others being more audacious, have ungirt and unbuckled thoſe whom they perceive to be more obliged and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to them by Luxury and carnall pleaſures and delights.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This art uſed <hi>Poppaea</hi> to <hi>Nero;</hi> of which yee
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115933:70"/>may ſee, in the words of the prince of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, in the 14. th of his Annals.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The female friends of Princes have oftimes more eaſily obliged ſome to them, after this mode and way then by flatteries or pleaſures. But, there is no conſtancy (as we have ſaid) in this kind of Love.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It were more convenient and agreeable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the love which thou haſt, (as it were) hatched to thee and bred by ſervices; ſhould be more ſtable and firme, as that which is ſprung from a more honeſt Cauſe; and fitter to allure and intice others, to the like offices and duties.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Yet very often, doth experience teach us the contrary; many times the chief benefits in Court are envyed, and thoſe whoſe turne and office they cannot requite; they oft revenge with hatred.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Such are not willing to be indebted to any man, much leſſe to a ſubject. They ſhun, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure not, that deſerving men ſhould ſee them, as thoſe who ſhould upbraid their ingratitude, which is the cauſe that their condition, in Court, is moſt miſerable; for, when by ſome office and ſervice they have merited from the Prince, they are forthwith conſtrained by ſhamefacedneſſe, not to require their reward; and ſeeme by feare, not to have given, but ſold their advantage and benefit. Princes, in the interim being careleſs of benefits and good turnes, and very ſloathfull as to compenſations and recompences, procraſtinate and put off from day to day; untill the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the benefits wither and fade away from the minds of thoſe, who are conſcious and privy
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115933:70"/>to them, who before feared ſome ſecret taunts and reproaches.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Some underſtanding thus much, have thought it good to ſtrike (as they ſay) while the Iron's hot; (that is to ſay) when they have known them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deſtinated and appoynted to ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain buſineſſe; before they would undertake it, have had an eye to the reward, knowing that the hope of receiving an Office, is more ſtrong and vali'd with Princes, then the Hopes of a reward; that it is better to be obliged to Rulers, then to oblige them; becauſe whom they oblige, they think ſhould be benevolous and bear them good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will; he who hath obliged them, (becauſe he may be thought not to love the Prince, who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him his recompence and reward) ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with odium and hatred, inſteed of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation. This was the judgement and opinion of <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11th, as <hi>Comineus</hi> reports.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Love towards thoſe who Miniſter aid and aſſiſtance to the Prince's volupty, and are obedient thereto, ſeems fit to be more ſtable, and is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſo long as the Prince is conſtant to his own inclinations: But (they being changed) ſuch as adminiſter to them, are alſo changed; ſometimes alſo the Prince, becomming conſcientious of what is honeſt, abominates and caſts away the Miniſters together with the vice.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Moreover as the inclinations of the Prince are ſome more durable and laſting then others; ſo alſo the favour which we have ſpoken of to ſuch as adminiſter to them, will be alterable and unconſtant.</p>

               <argument>
                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of the pleaſures of Princes. Veneriall Love. Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in evill actions. The affections of avarice and covetouſneſſe. Pretext of publique exactions and tazes. The moroſity and peeviſhneſſe of exacters denoted. The envy of Riches. What kind of avarice in a Prince may be conſummated and accompliſhed. The too much facility and gentleneſſe, and the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Miniſters, denoted and obſerved. A juſt occaſion of enriching a mans ſelfe, is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Shall not here meddle with all the volupties to which a Prince's natures are prone, becauſe they are not all ſuch, as upon which the heighth of Court-fortune can be ſuperſtructed and built. There is a three fold kind of them, too common and familiar with Princes which I will rehearſe <hi>viz.</hi> Veneriall Love, Cruelty, and Covetuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Veneriall Love, as it is moſtly vehementer then the reſt, ſo is it the more unconſtanter; which although it may laſt in him, yet will he not long love and like one and the ſame party; and though he may not change the ſubject, yet (to uſe the Scholaſtick terme) he will change and vary the object. Nevertheleſſe, very many have uſed this as the baſis and foundation wherein they have reared and built up their fortunes, not ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to proſtitute and debauch their own wives
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:115933:71"/>that they might attain the Prince's favour. As we read in <hi>Tacitus</hi>'s 13th book of Annal. that one <hi>Ortho</hi> did, yet this ſucceeded not ſo, as to ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate him: for <hi>Nero</hi> removed him from Court, leſt he ſhould have a Rival neer him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Others, that they might oblige the Prince, have aſſociated themſelves with him, and been contented to be witneſſes and miniſters of his miſdeeds and luſt. An example whereof was <hi>Tigel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus.</hi> Annal. 14th. Theſe conſider not, that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſcrupple not to ſacrifice ſuch men at length to publique envy, to free themſelves there from. Such ſervants of Luſt may expect the ſame which <hi>Remirus d'Orco</hi> (that Miniſter of Cruelties to <hi>Caeſar Borgia</hi>) experienced, whom <hi>Borgia</hi> at length commanded to be put to death, as the perſon guilty of all thoſe things, which himſelf had cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly acted and done.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And by this example of <hi>Remirus</hi> we may learn their ſate and deſtiny, who lend their aid to the cruelty of a Prince. Seldome is the Princes affection towards ſuch, long lived; both becauſe he afterwards reads his own vices in them, and alſo, becauſe he is afraid himſelf of them, whom he perceives and find ſo apt for villany.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Nero</hi> although of a cruell diſpoſition, and an old and crafty Polititian, after his mother was ſlaine hated <hi>Anicetus,</hi> whom he perceived to have upbraided him with his Matricide.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But leaſt of all, is that affection of covetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe mutable. The diverſity of object changes not that, as it doth Love; it is not leſſened and impaired with age, but increaſed; and although it be equally and alike hatefull to the people as
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115933:72"/>Cruelty is, yet is longer indured; becauſe exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have commonly a pretext of publique ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and honeſt parſimony, and likewiſe a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and ſhew of common utility. Hence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they who are Miniſters herein, may ſeem lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be ſheltred by the Prince's amity, whiles that they (which is rare in ſuch kind of men) be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther froward, nor teſty and difficult, not too gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of wealth and gain.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Moroſity, which for the moſt part is alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumelious and reproachfull, procures odium and envy both to the party, and to the Governour and Ruler of a people. The Author whereof the Prince at length will reject and caſt off, that ſo he may remove the envy from himſelf. Riches are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to envy, not only of the multitude, but ſometimes of the Prince himſelfe; who, if truly covetous, will ſeldome be contented to have wrung out and ſqueezed the full ſponge, which (as we read) <hi>Veſpatian</hi> was wont to do, but will imitate the Peaſants and Ruſtick people, who at laſt devoure and eat up thoſe ſwine, which they have formerly cramm'd and fatted.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Certes, the Kingdome of France hath ſeen many ſuch, who being rough and ſharp beyond meaſure, or too haſty to enrich themſelves, when they have acted too inſolently, after a great and lofty fortune, have been brought to perdition and ruine.</p>
               <p n="9">9. In the Reign of <hi>Philip</hi> the faire, one <hi>Peter Berchy</hi> being Chauncellor of the Exchequer, and of the Prince's bed Chamber, was ſtrangled at <hi>Paris. Lewis</hi> the ſon of <hi>Philip</hi> having after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards attain'd to the Kingdom, <hi>Enguerrandus Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigny</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:115933:72"/>fell into the like misfortune, under <hi>Charls</hi> the ſeventh. Guiſe in dignity equall to <hi>Berchy,</hi> being queſtioned by the law, was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſown up in a Sack, and drowned. His ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor <hi>Camus Beauly,</hi> was ſlain at <hi>Poitiers.</hi> The like Fate had befaln <hi>Peter Eſſart,</hi> in the time of <hi>Philip</hi> the firſt, had he not redeemed himſelf with a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand <hi>Florens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. I could name others, but I ſpare their memory, meane while the examples produced do ſufficiently inſtruct, that the facility of ſuch kind of Miniſters brings too much detriment and hurt to the Princes utility; but their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolency, attracteth hatred and deſtruction even to themſelves. Too much Riches are to be avoided, which may ſtirre up againſt us; as alſo it is lawfull, not to refuſe a juſt occaſion of being weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.</p>

                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aptitude and fitneſſe for buſineſſe in a Courtier, is the ultimate cauſe of Princely grace and favour. What conſideration is to be had therein, to wiſdome and glory. The weakeneſſe of Courtly power, Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aigne Counſell, for ſuch as act highly. A Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of a ſedate and quiet life, and of the Author's wiſh.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe laſt of the cauſes, for which Courtiers are beloved of the Prince, now remaines; which in the 37. th Chap. <hi>Numb.</hi> 2. we told you, was aptneſſe and expeditiouſneſſe in doing the Prince's buſineſſe; which when we have obſerved to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the Prince, we muſt alſo mark, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no it be therefore pleaſant and taken in good part, becauſe neceſſary; or becauſe the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's deſire provoked him, to ſuch an aptitude. If acceptable becauſe neceſſary, the love will endure ſo long as the neceſſity laſteth; nevertheleſſe it will be rather a forced, then a voluntary and free love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Prince aſpire the glory of this kind of aptitude, we may not doubt, but that they who in this ſhall exceed him; will in time be grievous to him. Sith that, there is an imbred deſire, not in Princes onely, but in all men, to excell all others in the art they profeſſe; Certes, no man ſcarcely can with an equall and moderate mind beare it, if he be ſurpaſſed by his houſhold ſervant.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:115933:73"/>3. <hi>Aſinius Pollio</hi> being exhorted by ſome to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer and require ſomething that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had written againſt him, with ſome verſes; anſwered <hi>Nolle ſe ejus, qui poſſit proſcribere, ſcribendo incurrere invidiam:</hi> That he would not incurre the Envy of him by writing, in whoſe power it lay to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe and baniſh him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There being a controverſie ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Favorinus</hi> a Philoſopher, and <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour, concerning ſome word, when the Emperour had poſed him, and his friends ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired it, he anſwered thus: <hi>Non erubeſco, vinci ſcientia ab illo, qui triginta Legionibus imperat:</hi> I am not aſhamed to be conquered in knowledge by him, who hath thirty Legions at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is a known precept of wiſdome <hi>Coram Rege noli videri Sapiens:</hi> Seem not to be wiſe in the preſence of the King. It cannot otherwiſe be, for to purchaſe the Prince's favour here, we ought to deſert and loſe our own glory: and not only when we have to do with words, but in every thing we ought to ſubmit and yield him the Palme of victory. And to that end, it will not be impertinent and beſides the purpoſe, that a man ſometimes admit againſt himſelfe ſomewhat (though a little hurtfull) even by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and procurement.</p>
               <p n="6">6. From the things hitherto diſcourſed on, it appeares, of what ſlender ſtability and durableneſs all kind of Court-powers are. Theſe therefore are the moſt ſoveraign advicements and counſels which can be given to ſuch as act highly and eminently, <hi>ad deſcenſunt in arenam praparareſeſe:</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:115933:74"/>to make them ready for Combat, though it be judged more generous and couragious, to fight him who enters the Liſt, than to flye. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding if we muſt fight with more perill then Guerdon and recompence, a man may not be aſhamed maturely to retreat, and to imitate the <hi>Parthians,</hi> who fight as they flye.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is alſo more gloriosu and commendable to deſcend ſlowly, and by gradatious and ſteps, then precipitately and raſhly to commit himſelf into others hands, and retreat through a certain and ſure poſterne, then to be thrown out at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. So having found a pretence, it is leſſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable, freely and ſpontaneouſly to bid adieu to honour, then to tarry till you be repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and removed. To this may be added the ſaying of an antient Roman, <hi>Quid fatigatae felicitate moleſtis es? Quid expectas donec Caſtris eijciaris?</hi> why art thou troubulous to tired felicity? why tarrieſt thou, till thou be removed out of the Camp?</p>
               <p n="8">8. 'Tis happineſſe (ſaith <hi>Seneca</hi>) to dye in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity. On the contrary, I deem him a happy Courtier, who in the middle of felicity betakes himſelf to a retirement. Peradventure he that doth ſo, ſhall not find the like judgment from all men in this particular, and ſhall ſeem unworthy of his fortune, the meſſenger whereof he ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly turns back: but who ſo is prudent will not ſtick at theſe ſayings, but will rather provide for his ſafety; and will call to mind, that at all Games and paſtimes which depend on fortune, 'tis better to break off a Gainer, then a Looſer; and that it is not a wiſe mans part to change certainties for hazards and doubtfull chances.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:115933:74"/>9. And moſtly men aſcend gradually to ſuch a heighth of dignities; but who will not admire to ſee one deſcend from on high, when he ſees no Staires or Ladders under him? And if ſo be that by the fulgor, and brightneſſe of too great a fortune, a man be inveigled and dazelled, and one pace or ſtep faile him (as may eaſily happen to ſuch as live in a lofty and high condition) they may not be ſaid then to deſcend, but to fall head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.</p>
